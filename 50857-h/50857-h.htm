    <div>Transcriber’s Note:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The original text includes annotations on two Greek texts, the
Epistle to the Colossians, and an Epistle to Philemon. On each page,
several lines of Greek are accompanied by a double column of
notations on key words. It was not possible to follow that convention
in this version, given the nature of our medium.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any hyphenations in the Greek text that occurred on page breaks have
been removed, and the word's end has been moved to the previous page.
On many occasions, a note appears on an earlier page than the text
it glosses. In this version, the notes have been arranged so that each
<em>follows</em> the text to which it refers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Greek text appears in a larger font and has been fitted with
‘←’ and ‘→’ links which serve as ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons, which
should aid in navigation across the pages as printed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are Greek inscriptions printed in an uncial font, and using a lunate
sigma (ϲ). These will appear here as <span class="uncial">μιμηταί μου γίνεϲθε</span>.
The occasional blackletter font appears here as ‘<span class='blackletter'>blackletter text</span>’.</p>

<p class='c000'>Footnotes have been moved to follow the Index, and are resequenced
to be unique across the text. Any internal references to those notes have
been modified as well. Links are provided for ease of navigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The index includes references to both pages and to the verses of the two
Epistles included here. Those references to a verse may refer to
either the Greek itself, or to any of the notes on that verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The links provided in the Index will direct the reader to the page,
or to the Greek verse itself. No attempt was made to link to the
specific note.</p>

<p class='c000'>Please consult the <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this text for any other issues
that arose during its presentation.</p>

wish again to renew my thanks for the assistance received
from previous labourers in the same field. Such obligations
must always be great; but it is not easy in a few words to
apportion them fairly, and I shall not make the attempt. I
have not consciously neglected any aid which might render
this volume more complete; but at the same time I venture
to hope that my previous commentaries have established my
claim to be regarded as an independent worker, and in the
present instance more especially I have found myself obliged
to diverge widely from the treatment of my predecessors, and
to draw largely from other materials than those which they
have collected.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the preface to a previous volume I expressed an intention
of appending to my commentary on the Colossian
Epistle an essay on ‘Christianity and Gnosis.’ This intention
has not been fulfilled in the letter; but the subject enters
largely into the investigation of the Colossian heresy, where
it receives as much attention as, at all events for the present,
it seems to require. It will necessarily come under discussion
again, when the Pastoral Epistles are taken in hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of the genuineness of the two epistles contained
in this volume has been deliberately deferred. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>could not be discussed with any advantage apart from the
Epistle to the Ephesians, for the three letters are inseparably
bound together. Meanwhile however the doctrinal and historical
discussions will, if I mistake not, have furnished answers
to the main objections which have been urged; while the
commentary will have shown how thoroughly natural the
language and thoughts are, if conceived as arising out of an
immediate emergency. More especially it will have been made
apparent that the Epistle to the Colossians hangs together
as a whole, and that the phenomena are altogether adverse
to any theory of interpolation such as that recently put forward
by Professor Holtzmann.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the commentary, as well as in the introduction, it has
been a chief aim to illustrate and develope the theological
conception of the Person of Christ, which underlies the Epistle
to the Colossians. The Colossian heresy for instance owes
its importance mainly to the fact that it throws out this
conception into bolder relief. To this portion of the subject
therefore I venture to direct special attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot conclude without offering my thanks to Mr A. A.
VanSittart who, as on former occasions, has given his aid
in correcting the proof sheets of this volume; and to the
Rev. J. J. Scott, of Trinity College, who has prepared the
index. I wish also to express my obligations to Dr Schiller-Szinessy,
of whose Talmudical learning I have freely availed
myself in verifying Frankel’s quotations and in other ways.
I should add however that he is not in any degree responsible
for my conclusions and has not even seen what I have written.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 id='chap01' class='c009'>I. <br /> THE CHURCHES OF THE LYCUS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c015'>Situation of the three cities.</div>

<p class='c000'>Lying in, or overhanging, the valley of the Lycus, a
tributary of the Mæander, were three neighbouring
towns, Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colossæ<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The river flows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>roughly speaking, from east to west; but at this point, which
is some few miles above its junction with the Mæander, its
direction is more nearly from south-east to north-west<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
Laodicea and Hierapolis stand face to face, being situated
respectively on the southern and northern sides of the valley,
at a distance of six miles<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and within sight of each other,
the river lying in the open plain between the two. The
site of Colossæ is somewhat higher up the stream, at a distance
of perhaps ten or twelve miles<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> from the point where the
road between Laodicea and Hierapolis crosses the Lycus.
Unlike Laodicea and Hierapolis, which overhang the valley on
opposite sides, Colossæ stands immediately on the river-bank,
the two parts of the town being divided by the stream. The
three cities lie so near to each other, that it would be quite
possible to visit them all in the course of a single day.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their neighbourhood and intercourse.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus situated, they would necessarily hold constant intercourse
with each other. We are not surprised therefore
to find them so closely connected in the earliest ages of
Christianity. It was the consequence of their position that
they owed their knowledge of the Gospel to the same evangelist,
that the same phases of thought prevailed in them,
and that they were exposed to the same temptations, moral
as well as intellectual.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Physical forces at work.</div>

<p class='c000'>The physical features of the neighbourhood are very striking.
Two potent forces of nature are actively at work to
change the face of the country, the one destroying old land-marks,
the other creating fresh ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Frequent earthquakes.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>On the one hand, the valley of the Lycus was and is
especially liable to violent earthquakes. The same danger
indeed extends over large portions of Asia Minor, but this
district is singled out by ancient writers<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> (and the testimony
of modern travellers confirms the statement<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a>), as the chief
theatre of these catastrophes. Not once or twice only in the
history of Laodicea do we read of such visitations laying waste
the city itself or some flourishing town in the neighbourhood<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
Though the exterior surface of the earth shows no traces of
recent volcanoes, still the cavernous nature of the soil and
the hot springs and mephitic vapours abounding here indicate
the presence of those subterranean fires, which from time to
time have manifested themselves in this work of destruction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deposits of travertine.</div>

<p class='c000'>But, while the crust of the earth is constantly broken up
by these forces from beneath, another agency is actively employed
above ground in laying a new surface. If fire has
its fitful outbursts of devastation, water is only less powerful in
its gradual work of reconstruction. The lateral streams which
swell the waters of the Lycus are thickly impregnated with
calcareous matter, which they deposit in their course. The
travertine formations of this valley are among the most remarkable
in the world, surpassing even the striking phenomena
of Tivoli and Clermont<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. Ancient monuments are
buried, fertile lands overlaid, river-beds choked up and streams
diverted, fantastic grottos and cascades and archways of stone
formed, by this strange capricious power, at once destructive
and creative, working silently and relentlessly through long
ages. Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a
stony shroud over the ground. Gleaming like glaciers on the
hill-side  they attract the eye of the traveller at a distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of twenty miles<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a>, and form a singularly striking feature in
scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Produce and manufactures of the district.</div>

<p class='c000'>At the same time, along with these destructive agencies,
the fertility of the district was and is unusually great. Its
rich pastures fed large flocks of sheep, whose fleeces were of
a superior quality; and the trade in dyed woollen goods was
the chief source of prosperity to these towns. For the bounty
of nature was not confined to the production of the material,
but extended also to the preparation of the fabric. The
mineral streams had chemical qualities, which were highly
valued by the dyer<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a>. Hence we find that all the three towns,
with which we are concerned, were famous in this branch of
trade. At Hierapolis, as at Thyatira, the guild of the dyers
appears in the inscriptions as an important and influential
body<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a>. Their colours vied in brilliancy with the richest
scarlets and purples of the farther east<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a>. Laodicea again was
famous for the colour of its fleeces, probably a glossy black,
which was much esteemed<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. Here also we read of a guild
of dyers<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a>. And lastly, Colossæ gave its name to a peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>dye, which seems to  have  been some shade of purple, and
from which it derived a considerable revenue<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. <span class='sc'>Laodicea.</span></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Its name and history.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. Of these three towns <span class='sc'>Laodicea</span>, as the most important,
deserves to be considered first. Laodice was a common name
among the ladies of the royal house of the Seleucidæ, as
Antiochus was among the princes. Hence Antiochia and Laodicea
occur frequently as the designations of cities within
the dominions of the Syrian kings. Laodicea on the Lycus<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a>,
as it was surnamed to distinguish it from  other  towns so
called, and more especially perhaps from its near neighbour
Laodicea Catacecaumene, had borne in succession the names
of Diospolis and Rhoas<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a>; but when refounded by Antiochus
Theos (<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 261–246), it was newly designated after his wife
Laodice<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. It is situated<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> on an undulating hill, or group
of hills, which overhangs the valley on the south, being washed
on either side by the streams of the Asopus and the Caprus,
tributaries of the Lycus<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a>. Behind it rise the snow-capped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>heights of Cadmus, the lofty mountain barrier which shuts in
the south side of the main valley<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its growing prosperity.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A place of no great
importance at first, it made rapid strides in the last days
of the republic and under the earliest Cæsars, and had become,
two or three generations before St Paul wrote, a populous
and thriving city<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a>. Among its famous inhabitants
are mentioned the names of some philosophers, sophists, and
rhetoricians, men renowned in their day but forgotten or
almost forgotten now<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a>. More to our purpose, as illustrating
the boasted wealth and prosperity of the city, which appeared
as a reproach and a stumblingblock in an Apostle’s eyes<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a>, are
the facts, that one of its citizens, Polemo, became a king and a
father of kings, and that another, Hiero, having accumulated
enormous wealth, bequeathed all his property to the people
and adorned the city with costly gifts<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a>. To the good fortune
of her principal sons, as well as to the fertility of the country
around, the geographer Strabo ascribes the increase and prosperity
of Laodicea. The ruins of public buildings still bear
testimony by their number and magnificence to the past greatness
of the city<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its political rank, as the capital of a <em>conventus</em>.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Not less important, as throwing light on the Apostolic
history, is the  political status of Laodicea. Asia Minor
under the Romans was divided into districts, each comprising
several towns and having its chief city, in which the
courts were held from time to time by the proconsul or
legate of the province, and where the taxes from the subordinate
towns were collected<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a>. Each of these political aggregates
was styled in Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>conventus</em></span>, in Greek διοίκησις—a
term afterwards borrowed by the Christian Church, being
applied to a similar ecclesiastical aggregate, and thus naturalised
in the languages of Christendom as <em>diocese</em>. At the
head of the most important of these political dioceses, the
‘Cibyratic convention’ or ‘jurisdiction,’ as it was called, comprising
not less than twenty-five towns, stood Laodicea<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.
Here in times past Cicero, as proconsul of Cilicia, had held
his court<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a>; hither at stated seasons flocked suitors, advocates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>clerks, sheriffs’-officers, tax-collectors, pleasure-seekers,
courtiers—all those crowds whom business or leisure or policy
or curiosity would draw together from a wealthy and populous
district, when the representative of the laws and the majesty
of Rome appeared to receive homage and to hold his assize<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a>.
To this position as the chief city of the Cibyratic union the
inscriptions probably refer, when they style Laodicea the
‘metropolis<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.’ And in its metropolitan rank we see an
explanation of the fact, that to Laodicea, as to the centre
of a Christian diocese also, whence their letters would readily
be circulated among the neighbouring brotherhoods, two
Apostles address themselves in succession, the one writing
from his captivity in Rome<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a>, the other from his exile at
Patmos<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its religious<br />worship.</div>

<p class='c000'>On the religious worship of Laodicea very little special information
exists. Its tutelary deity was Zeus, whose guardianship
had been recognised in Diospolis, the older name of the
city, and who, having (according to the legend) commanded its
rebuilding, was commemorated on its coins with the surname
Laodicenus<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. Occasionally he is also called Aseis, a title which
perhaps reproduces a Syrian epithet of this deity, ‘the mighty.’
If this interpretation be correct, we have a link of connexion
between Laodicea and the religions of the farther East—a connexion
far from improbable, considering that Laodicea was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>refounded by a Syrian king and is not unlikely to have
adopted some features of Syrian worship<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. <span class='sc'>Hierapolis.</span></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Its situation.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. On the north of the valley, opposite to  the sloping
hills which mark the site of Laodicea, is a broad level terrace
jutting out from the mountain side and overhanging the plain
with almost precipitous sides. On this plateau are scattered
the vast ruins of <span class='sc'>Hierapolis</span><a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a>. The mountains upon which
it abuts occupy the wedge of ground between the Mæander
and the  Lycus; but, as the Mæander above its junction
with the Lycus passes through a narrow ravine, they blend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>when seen from a distance, with the loftier range of the
Mesogis which overhangs the right bank of the Mæander
almost from its source to its embouchure, and form with it
the northern barrier to the view, as the Cadmus range
does the southern, the broad valley stretching between.
Thus Hierapolis may be said to lie over against Mesogis, as
Laodicea lies over against Cadmus<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable physical features.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is at Hierapolis that the remarkable physical features
which distinguish the valley of the Lycus display themselves
in the fullest perfection. Over the steep cliffs which support
the plateau of the city, tumble cascades of pure white stone,
the deposit of calcareous matter from the streams which, after
traversing this upper level, are precipitated over the ledge
into the plain beneath and assume the most fantastic shapes
in their descent. At one time overhanging in cornices fringed
with stalactites, at another hollowed out into basins or broken
up with ridges, they mark the site of the city at a distance,
glistening on the mountain-side like foaming cataracts frozen
in the fall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their relation to the Apostolic history.</div>

<p class='c000'>But for the immediate history of St Paul’s Epistles the
striking beauty of the scenery has no value. It is not
probable that he had visited this district when the letters
to the Colossians and Laodiceans were written. Were it
otherwise, we can hardly suppose, that educated under widely
different influences and occupied with deeper and more absorbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>thoughts, he would have shared the enthusiasm which this
scenery inspires in the modern traveller. Still it will give
a reality to our conceptions, if we try to picture to ourselves
the external features of that city, which was destined before
long to become the adopted home of Apostles and other
personal disciples of the Lord, and to play a conspicuous part—second
perhaps only to Ephesus—in the history of the Church
during the ages immediately succeeding the Apostles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hierapolis a famous watering-place.</div>

<p class='c000'>Like Laodicea, Hierapolis was at this time an important
and a growing city, though not like Laodicea holding metropolitan
rank<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a>. Besides the trade in dyed wools, which it
shared in common with the neighbouring towns, it had another
source of wealth and prosperity peculiar to itself. The streams
to which the scenery owes the remarkable features already
described, are endowed with valuable medicinal qualities,
while at the same time they are so copious that the ancient
city is described as full of self-made baths<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. An inscription,
still legible among the ruins, celebrates their virtues in heroic
verse, thus apostrophizing the city:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hail, fairest soil in all broad Asia’s realm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hail, golden city, nymph divine, bedeck’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With flowing rills, thy jewels<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Coins of Hierapolis too are extant of various types, on which
Æsculapius and Hygeia appear either singly or together<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a>.
To this fashionable watering-place, thus favoured by nature,
seekers of pleasure and seekers of health alike were drawn.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The magnificence of its ruins.</div>

<p class='c000'>To the ancient magnificence of Hierapolis its extant ruins
bear ample testimony. More favoured than Laodicea, it has
not in its immediate neighbourhood any modern town or
village of importance, whose inhabitants have been tempted
to quarry materials for their houses out of the memorials of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>its former greatness. Hence the whole plateau is covered with
ruins, of which the extent and the good taste are equally remarkable;
and of these the palæstra and the thermæ, as
might be expected, are among the more prominent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its religious worship.</div>

<p class='c000'>A city, which combined the pursuit of health and of
gaiety, had fitly chosen as its patron deity Apollo, the god
alike of medicine and of festivity, here worshipped especially
as ‘Archegetes,’ the Founder<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a>. But more important, as illustrating
the religious temper of this Phrygian city, is another
fact connected with it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Plutonium.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In Hierapolis was a spot called the
Plutonium, a hot well or spring, from whose narrow mouth
issued a mephitic vapour immediately fatal to those who
stood over the opening and inhaled its fumes. To the mutilated
priests of Cybele alone (so it was believed) an immunity
was given from heaven, which freed them from its deadly
effects<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a>. Indeed this city appears to have been a chief centre
of the passionate mystical devotion of ancient Phrygia. But
indications are not wanting, that in addition to this older
worship religious rites were borrowed also from other parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of the East, more especially from Egypt<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a>. By the multitude
of her temples Hierapolis established her right to the title of
the ‘sacred city,’ which she bore<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The birth-place of Epictetus.</div>

<p class='c000'>Though at this time we have no record of famous citizens
at Hierapolis, such as graced the annals of Laodicea, yet a generation
or two later she numbered among her sons one nobler
far than the rhetoricians and sophists, the millionaires and
princes, of whom her neighbour could boast. The lame slave
Epictetus, the loftiest of heathen moralists, must have been
growing up to manhood when the first rumours of the Gospel
reached his native city. Did any chance throw him across
the path of Epaphras, who first announced the glad-tidings
there? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Epictetus and Christianity.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Did he ever meet the great Apostle himself, while
dragging out his long captivity at Rome, or when after his
release he paid his long-promised visit to the valley of the
Lycus? We should be glad to think that these two men met
together face to face—the greatest of Christian, and the greatest
of heathen preachers. Such a meeting would solve more
than one riddle. A Christian Epictetus certainly was not;
his Stoic doctrine and his Stoic morality are alike apparent:
but nevertheless his language presents some strange coincidences
with the Apostolic writings, which would thus receive
an explanation<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a>. It must be confessed however, that of any
outward intercourse between the Apostle and the philosopher
history furnishes no hint.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. <span class='sc'>Colossæ.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>3. While the sites of Laodicea and Hierapolis are conspicuous,
so that they were early identified by their ruins,
the same is not the case with <span class='sc'>Colossæ</span>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difficulty of determining its site.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Only within the
present generation has the position of this once famous city
been ascertained, and even now it lacks the confirmation of any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>inscription found <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>in situ</em></span> and giving the name<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Subterranean channel of the Lycus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Herodotus
states that in Colossæ the river Lycus disappears in a subterranean
cave, emerging again at a distance of about five
stades<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a>; and this very singular landmark--the underground
passage of a stream for half a mile—might be thought to have
placed the site of the city beyond the reach of controversy.
But this is not the case. In the immediate neighbourhood of
the only ruins which can possibly be identified with Colossæ,
no such subterranean channel has been discovered. But on
the other hand the appearance of the river at this point suggests
that at one time the narrow gorge through which it runs, as
it traverses the ruins, was overarched for some distance with incrustations
of travertine, and that this natural bridge was broken
up afterwards by an earthquake, so as to expose the channel
of the stream<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a>. This explanation seems satisfactory. If it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>rejected, we must look for the underground channel, not within
the city itself, as the words of Herodotus strictly interpreted
require, but at some point higher up the stream. In either
case there can be little doubt that these are the ruins of
Colossæ. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Petrifying stream.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The fact mentioned by Pliny<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a>, that there is in this
city a river which turns brick into stone, is satisfied by a side
stream flowing into the Lycus from the north, and laying
large deposits of calcareous matter; though in this region, as
we have seen, such a phenomenon is very far from rare. The
site of Colossæ then, as determined by these considerations, lies
two or three miles north of the present town of Chonos, the
mediæval Chonæ, and some twelve miles east of Laodicea.
The Lycus traverses the site of the ruins, dividing the city
into two parts, the necropolis standing on the right or northern
bank, and the town itself on the left.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its ancient greatness</div>

<p class='c000'>Commanding the approaches to a pass in the Cadmus range,
and standing on a great high-way communicating between
Eastern and Western Asia, Colossæ at an early date appears
as a very important place. Here the mighty host of Xerxes
halted on its march against Greece; it is mentioned on this
occasion as ‘a great city of Phrygia<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a>.’ Here too Cyrus remained
seven days on his daring enterprise which terminated so
fatally; the Greek captain, who records the expedition, speaks
of it as ‘a populous city, prosperous and great<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a>.’ But after
this time its glory seems to wane. The political supremacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and later decline.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>of Laodicea and the growing popularity of Hierapolis gradually
drain its strength; and Strabo, writing about two generations
before St Paul, describes it as a ‘small town<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a>’ in the
district of which Laodicea was the capital. We shall therefore
be prepared to find that, while Laodicea and Hierapolis
both hold important places in the early records of the Church,
Colossæ disappears wholly from the pages of history. Its comparative
insignificance is still attested by its ruins, which are
few and meagre<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a>, while the vast remains of temples, baths,
theatres, aqueducts, gymnasia, and sepulchres, strewing the
extensive sites of its more fortunate neighbours, still bear witness
to their ancient prosperity and magnificence. It is not
even mentioned by Ptolemy, though his enumeration of towns
includes several inconsiderable places<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a>. Without doubt Colossæ
was the least important Church, to which any epistle of
St Paul was addressed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Uncertain orthography of the name.</div>

<p class='c000'>And perhaps also we may regard the variation in the
orthography of the name as another indication of its comparative
obscurity and its early extinction. Are we to write
<em>Colossæ</em> or <em>Colassæ</em>? So far as the evidence goes, the conclusion
would seem to be that, while Colossæ alone occurs
during the classical period and in St Paul’s time, it was afterwards
supplanted by Colassæ, when the town itself had either
disappeared altogether or was already passing out of notice<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ethnological relations of the three cities.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Considered ethnologically, these three cities are generally
regarded as belonging to Phrygia. But as they are situated
on the western border of Phrygia, and as the frontier line
separating Phrygia from Lydia and Caria was not distinctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>traced, this designation is not persistent<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a>. Thus Laodicea is
sometimes assigned to Caria, more rarely to Lydia<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a>; and again,
Hierapolis is described as half Lydian, half Phrygian<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a>. On
the other hand I have not observed that Colossæ is ever regarded
as other than Phrygian<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a>, partly perhaps because the
notices relating to it belong to an earlier date when these
several names denoted political as well as ethnological divisions,
and their limits were definitely marked in consequence,
but chiefly because it lies some miles to the east of the other
cities, and therefore farther from the doubtful border land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their political relations.</div>

<p class='c000'>Phrygia however ceased to have any political significance,
when this country came under the dominion of the Romans.
Politically speaking, the three cities with the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Cibyratic union belonged at this time to Asia, the proconsular
province<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a>. As an <em>Asiatic</em> Church accordingly Laodicea
is addressed in the Apocalyptic letter. To this province they
had been assigned in the first instance; then they were handed
over to Cilicia<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a>; afterwards they were transferred and re-transferred
from the one to the other; till finally, before the
Christian era, they became a permanent part of Asia, their
original province. Here they remained, until the close of the
fourth century, when a new distribution of the Roman empire
was made, and the province of Phrygia Pacatiana created with
Laodicea as its capital<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Important Jewish settlement in this neighbourhood.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Epistle to the Colossians supposes a powerful Jewish
colony in Laodicea and the neighbourhood. We are not however
left to draw this inference from the epistle alone, but the
fact is established by ample independent testimony. When,
with the insolent licence characteristic of Oriental kings, Antiochus
the Great transplanted two thousand Jewish families
from Babylonia and Mesopotamia into Lydia and Phrygia<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a>,<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Colony of Antiochus the Great.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we can hardly doubt that among the principal stations of these
new colonists would be the two most thriving cities of Phrygia,
which were also the two most important settlements of the
Syrian kings, Apamea and Laodicea, the one founded by
his grandfather Antiochus the First, the other by his father
Antiochus the Second. If the commercial importance of Apamea
at this time was greater (for somewhat later it was reckoned
second only to Ephesus among the cities of Asia Minor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>as a centre of trade), the political rank of Laodicea stood
higher<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a>. When mention is made of Lydia and Phrygia<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a>,
this latter city especially is pointed out by its position, for it
stood near the frontier of the two countries. A Jewish settlement
once established, the influx of their fellow-countrymen
would be rapid and continuous. Accordingly under the Roman
domination we find them gathered here in very large numbers.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Confiscations of Flaccus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When Flaccus the proprætor of Asia (<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 62), who was afterwards
accused of maladministration in his province and defended by
Cicero, forbade the contributions of the Jews to the temple-worship
and the consequent exportation of money to Palestine,
he seized as contraband not less than twenty pounds weight in
gold in the single district of which Laodicea was the capital<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a>.
Calculated at the rate of a half-shekel for each man, this sum
represents a population of more than eleven thousand adult
freemen<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a>; for women, children, and slaves were exempted. It
must be remembered however, that this is only the sum which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the Roman officers succeeded in detecting and confiscating;
and that therefore the whole Jewish population would probably
be much larger than this partial estimate implies. The
amount seized at Apamea, the other great Phrygian centre,
was five times as large as this<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Other evidence.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Somewhat later we have a
document purporting to be a decree of the Laodiceans, in which
they thank the Roman Consul for a measure granting to
Jews the liberty of observing their sabbaths and practising
other rites of their religion<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a>; and though this decree is probably
spurious, yet it serves equally well to show that at this
time Laodicea was regarded as an important centre of the
dispersion in Asia Minor. To the same effect may be quoted
the extravagant hyperbole in the Talmud, that when on a certain
occasion an insurrection of the Jews broke out in Cæsarea
the metropolis of Cappadocia, which brought down upon their
heads the cruel vengeance of king Sapor and led to a massacre
of 12,000, ‘the wall of Laodicea was cloven with the
sound of the harpstrings’ in the fatal and premature merriment
of the insurgents<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a>. This place was doubtless singled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>out, because it had a peculiar interest for the Jews, as one
of their chief settlements<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a>. It will be remembered also, that
Phrygia is especially mentioned among those countries which
furnished their quota of worshippers at Jerusalem, and were
thus represented at the baptism of the Christian Church on
the great day of Pentecost<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Special attractions of Hierapolis.</div>

<p class='c000'>Mention has already been made of the traffic in dyed wools,
which formed the staple of commerce in the valley of the
Lycus<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a>. It may be inferred from other notices that this branch
of trade had a peculiar attraction for the Jews<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a>. If so, their
commercial instincts would constantly bring fresh recruits to a
colony which was already very considerable. But the neighbourhood
held out other inducements besides this. Hierapolis, the
gay watering place, the pleasant resort of idlers, had charms
for them, as well as Laodicea the busy commercial city. At
least such was the complaint of stricter patriots at home.
‘The wines and the baths of Phrygia,’ writes a Talmudist bitterly,
‘have separated the ten tribes from Israel<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul had not visited the district when he wrote.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>There is no ground for supposing that, when St Paul wrote
his Epistle to the Colossians, he had ever visited the church
in which he evinces so deep an interest. Whether we examine
the narrative in the Acts, or whether we gather up
the notices in the epistle itself, we find no hint that he had
ever been in this neighbourhood; but on the contrary some
expressions indirectly exclude the supposition of a visit to
the district.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is meant by <em>Phrygia</em> in St Luke?</div>

<p class='c000'>It is true that St Luke more than once mentions Phrygia
as lying on St Paul’s route or as witnessing his labours.
But Phrygia was a vague and comprehensive term; nor can
we assume that the valley of the Lycus was intended, unless
the direction of his route or the context of the narrative distinctly
points to this south-western corner of Phrygia. In
neither of the two passages, where St Paul is stated to have
travelled through Phrygia, is this the case.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. St Paul’s visit to Phrygia on his second missionary journey.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. On his second missionary journey, after he has revisited
and confirmed the churches of Pisidia and Lycaonia founded
on his first visit, he passes through ‘the Phrygian and Galatian
country<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a>.’ I have pointed out elsewhere that this expression
must be used to denote the region which might be called indifferently
Phrygia or Galatia—the land which had originally
belonged to the Phrygians and had afterwards been colonised
by the Gauls; or the parts of either country which lay in the
immediate neighbourhood of this debatable ground<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a>. This
region lies considerably north and east of the valley of the
Lycus. Assuming that the last of the Lycaonian and Pisidian
towns at which St Paul halted was Antioch, he would not on
any probable supposition approach nearer to Colossæ than
Apamea Cibotus on his way to ‘the Phrygian and Galatian
country’, nor indeed need he have gone nearly so far westward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>as this. And again on his departure from this region
he journeys by Mysia to Troas, leaving ‘Asia’ on his left
hand and Bithynia on his right. Thus the notices of his
route conspire to show that his path on this occasion lay
far away from the valley of the Lycus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. His visit on his third missionary journey.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. But if he was not brought into the neighbourhood
of Colossæ on his second missionary journey, it is equally
improbable that he visited it on his third. So far as regards
Asia Minor, he seems to have confined himself to revisiting
the churches already founded; the new ground which he broke
was in Macedonia and Greece. Thus when we are told that
during this third journey St Paul after leaving Antioch ‘passed
in order through the Galatian country and Phrygia, confirming
all the disciples,’<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a> we can hardly doubt that ‘the Galatian
country and Phrygia’ in this latter passage denotes essentially
the same region as ‘the Phrygian and Galatian country’ in
the former. The slight change of expression is explained by
the altered direction of his route. In the first instance his
course, as determined by its extreme limits—Antioch in Pisidia
its starting point, and Alexandria Troas its termination—would
be northward for the first part of the way, and thus
would lie on the border land of Phrygia and Galatia; whereas
on this second occasion, when he was travelling from Antioch
in Syria to Ephesus, its direction would be generally
from east to west, and the more strictly Galatian district
would be traversed before the Phrygian. If we suppose him
to leave Galatia at Pessinus on its western border, he would
pass along the great highway—formerly a Persian and at this
time a Roman road—by Synnada and Sardis to Ephesus,
traversing the heart of Phrygia, but following the valleys of
the Hermus and Cayster, and separated from the Mæander
and Lycus by the high mountain ranges which bound these
latter to the north<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The inference from</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Thus St Luke’s narrative seems to exclude any visit of
the Apostle to the Churches of the Lycus before his first

own language to the Colossians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>borne out by St Paul’s own language.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>He represents his knowledge of their continued progress,
and even of their first initiation, in the truths of the Gospel,
as derived from the report of others.  He describes himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>as <em>hearing</em> of their faith in Christ and their love to the saints<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a>.
He recalls the day when he first <em>heard</em> of their Christian profession
and zeal<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a>. .<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Silence of St Paul.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Though opportunities occur again and again
where he would naturally have referred to his direct personal
relations with them, if he had been their evangelist, he abstains
from any such reference. He speaks of their being instructed
in the Gospel, of his own preaching the Gospel, several times
in the course of the letter, but he never places the two in
any direct connexion, though the one reference stands in the
immediate neighbourhood of the other<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a>. Moreover, if he had
actually visited Colossæ, it must appear strange that he should
not once allude to any incident occurring during his sojourn
there, for this epistle would then be the single exception to
his ordinary practice. And lastly; in one passage at least, if
interpreted in its natural sense, he declares that the Colossians
were personally unknown to him: ‘I would have you
know,’ he writes, ‘how great a conflict I have for you and
them that are in Laodicea and as many as have not seen my
face in the flesh’<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Epaphras was the evangelist of this district.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>But, if he was not directly their evangelist, yet to him
they were indirectly indebted for their knowledge of the truth.
Epaphras had been his delegate to them, his representative
in Christ. By Epaphras they had been converted to the Gospel.
This is the evident meaning of a passage in the opening
of the epistle, which has been much obscured by misreading
and mistranslation, and which may be paraphrased thus: ‘The
Gospel, which has spread and borne fruit throughout the rest
of the world, has been equally successful among yourselves.
This fertile growth has been manifested in you from the first
day when the message of God’s grace was preached to you,
and accepted by you—preached not as now with adulterations
by these false teachers, but in its genuine simplicity by
Epaphras our beloved fellowservant; he has been a faithful
minister of Christ and a faithful representative of us, and from
him we have received tidings of your love in the Spirit’<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul’s residence at Ephesus instrumental in their conversion.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>How or when the conversion of the Colossians took place,
we have no direct information. Yet it can hardly be wrong to
connect the event with St Paul’s long sojourn at Ephesus.
Here he remained preaching for three whole years. It is
possible indeed that during this period he paid short visits to
other neighbouring cities of Asia: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 54–57.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but if so, the notices in the
Acts oblige us to suppose these interruptions to his residence
in Ephesus to have been slight and infrequent<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a>. Yet, though
the Apostle himself was stationary in the capital, the Apostle’s
influence and teaching spread far beyond the limits of the city
and its immediate neighbourhood. It was hardly an exaggeration
when Demetrius declared that ‘almost throughout
all Asia this Paul had persuaded and turned away much
people’<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a>. The sacred historian himself uses equally strong
language in describing the effects of the Apostle’s preaching;
‘All they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord,
both Jews and Greeks’<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a>. In accordance with these notices,
the Apostle himself in an epistle written during this sojourn
sends salutations to Corinth, not from the Church of Ephesus
specially, as might have been anticipated, but from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>‘Churches of Asia’ generally<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a>. St Luke, it should be observed,
ascribes this dissemination of the Gospel, not to journeys
undertaken by the Apostle, but to his preaching at Ephesus
itself<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a>. Thither, as to the metropolis of Western Asia,
would flock crowds from all the towns and villages far and near.
Thence they would carry away, each to his own neighbourhood,
the spiritual treasure which they had so unexpectedly
found.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Close alliance of these cities with Ephesus.</div>

<p class='c000'>Among the places thus represented at the Asiatic metropolis
would doubtless be the cities lying in the valley of the

appear to have been unusually strong. The <cite>Concord of the

Thus the Colossians, Epaphras and Philemon,
the latter with his household<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a>, and perhaps also the
Laodicean Nymphas<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a>, would fall in with the Apostle of the
Gentiles and hear from his lips the first tidings of a heavenly
life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>but especially Epaphras.</div>

<p class='c000'>But, whatever service may have been rendered by Philemon
at Colossæ, or by Nymphas at Laodicea, it was to Epaphras
especially that all the three cities were indebted for their
knowledge of the Gospel. Though he was a Colossian by birth,
the fervency of his prayers and the energy of his love are represented
as extending equally to Laodicea and Hierapolis<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a>.
It is obvious that he looked upon himself as responsible for
the spiritual well-being of all alike.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul still a stranger to this district.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>We pass over a period of five or six years. St Paul’s
first captivity in Rome is now drawing to a close. During
this interval he has not once visited the valley of the Lycus.
He has, it is true, skirted the coast and called at Miletus,
which lies near the mouth of the Mæander; but, though the
elders of Ephesus were summoned to meet him there<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a>, no
mention is made of any representatives from these more distant
towns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His imprisonment at Rome.</div>

<p class='c000'>I have elsewhere described the Apostle’s circumstances
during his residence in Rome, so far as they are known to
us<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a>. It is sufficient to say here, that though he is still a
prisoner, friends new and old minister freely to his wants.
Meanwhile the alienation of the Judaic Christians is complete.
Three only, remaining faithful to him, are commemorated as
honourable exceptions in the general desertion<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c016'><sup>[97]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Colossæ brought before his notice by two incidents.</div>

<p class='c000'>We have seen that Colossæ was an unimportant place, and
that it had no direct personal claims on the Apostle. We
might therefore feel surprise that, thus doubly disqualified,
it should nevertheless attract his special attention at a critical
moment, when severe personal trials were superadded to ‘the
care of all the churches.’ But two circumstances, the one
affecting his public duties, the other private and personal,
happening at this time, conspired to bring Colossæ prominently
before his notice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The mission of <span class='sc'>Epaphras</span>.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. He had received a visit from <span class='sc'>Epaphras</span>. The dangerous
condition of the Colossian and neighbouring churches had
filled the mind of their evangelist with alarm. A strange
form of heresy had broken out in these brotherhoods—a combination
of Judaic formalism with Oriental mystic speculation—and
was already spreading rapidly. His distress was
extreme. He gratefully acknowledged and reported their faith
in Christ and their works of love<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a>. But this only quickened
his anxiety. He had ‘much toil for them’; he was ‘ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>wrestling in his prayers on their behalf,’ that they might
stand fast and not abandon the simplicity of their earlier faith<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a>.
He came to Rome, we may suppose, for the express purpose
of laying this state of things before the Apostle and seeking
his counsel and assistance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. <span class='sc'>Onesimus</span> a fugitive in Rome.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. But at the time when Epaphras paid this visit, St Paul
was also in communication with another Colossian, who had
visited Rome under very different circumstances. <span class='sc'>Onesimus</span>,
the runaway slave, had sought the metropolis, the common
sink of all nations<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c016'><sup>[100]</sup></a>, probably as a convenient hiding place,
where he might escape detection among its crowds and make
a livelihood as best he could. Here, perhaps accidentally,
perhaps through the intervention of Epaphras, he fell in with
his master’s old friend. The Apostle interested himself in his
case, instructed him in the Gospel, and transformed him from
a good-for-nothing slave<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> into a ‘faithful and beloved brother<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Apostle despatches three letters simultaneously.</div>

<p class='c000'>This combination of circumstances called the Apostle’s attention
to the Churches of the Lycus, and more especially to
Colossæ. His letters, which had been found ‘weighty and
powerful’ in other cases, might not be unavailing now; and
in this hope he took up his pen. Three epistles were written
and despatched at the same time to this district.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The <span class='sc'>Epistle to the Colossians</span>.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. He addresses a special letter to the <span class='sc'>Colossians</span>, written
in the joint names of himself and Timothy, warning them
against the errors of the false teachers. He gratefully acknowledges
the report which he has received of their love
and zeal<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a>. He assures them of the conflict which agitates
him on their behalf<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a>. He warns them to be on their guard
against the delusive logic of enticing words, against the vain
deceit of a false philosophy<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The theological and the practical error of the Colossians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The purity of their Christianity
is endangered by two errors, recommended to them by their
heretical leaders—the one theological, the other practical—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>both alike springing from the same source, the conception
of matter as the origin and abode of evil. Thus, regarding
God and matter as directly antagonistic and therefore apart
from and having no communication with each other, they sought
to explain the creation and government of the world by interposing
a series of intermediate beings, emanations or angels,
to whom accordingly they offered worship. At the same time,
since they held that evil resided, not in the rebellious spirit of
man, but in the innate properties of matter, they sought to
overcome it by a rigid ascetic discipline, which failed after all to
touch the springs of action. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The proper corrective to both lies in the Christ of the Gospel.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>As both errors flowed from the
same source, they must be corrected by the application of the
same remedy, the Christ of the Gospel. In the Person of Christ,
the one mediator between heaven and earth, is the true solution
of the theological difficulty. Through the Life in Christ, the
purification of the heart through faith and love, is the effectual
triumph over moral evil<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>References to Epaphras.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>St Paul therefore prescribes to
the Colossians the true teaching of the Gospel, as the best antidote
to the twofold danger which threatens at once their theological
creed and their moral principles; while at the same
time he enforces his lesson by the claims of personal affection,
appealing to the devotion of their evangelist Epaphras on
their behalf<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Epaphras himself we know nothing beyond the few but
significant notices which connect him with Colossæ<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a>. He did
not return to Colossæ as the bearer of the letter, but remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>behind with St Paul<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a>. As St Paul in a contemporary epistle
designates him his fellow-prisoner<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a>, it may be inferred that
his zeal and affection had involved him in the Apostle’s captivity,
and that his continuance in Rome was enforced. But
however this may be, the letter was placed in the hands of
Tychicus, a native of proconsular Asia, probably of Ephesus<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a>,<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tychicus and Onesimus accompany the letter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who was entrusted with a wider mission at this time, and in its
discharge would be obliged to visit the valley of the Lycus<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a>.
At the same time he was accompanied by Onesimus, whom the
Colossians had only known hitherto as a worthless slave, but
who now returns to them with the stamp of the Apostle’s warm
approval. St Paul says very little about himself, because
Tychicus and Onesimus would be able by word of mouth to
communicate all information to the Colossians<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The salutations.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But he sends
one or two salutations which deserve a few words of explanation.
Epaphras of course greets his fellow-townsmen and
children in the faith. Other names are those of Aristarchus
the Thessalonian, who had been with the Apostle at Ephesus<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
and may possibly have formed some personal connexion with
the Colossians at that time: Mark, against whom apparently
the Apostle fears that a prejudice may be entertained (perhaps
the fact of his earlier desertion, and of St Paul’s dissatisfaction
in consequence<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a>, may have been widely known), and for whom
therefore he asks a favourable reception at his approaching
visit to Colossæ, according to instructions which they had already
received; and Jesus the Just, of whose relations with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Colossians we know nothing, and whose only claim to a mention
may have been his singular fidelity to the Apostle at a
critical juncture. Salutations moreover are added from Luke
and from Demas; and here again their close companionship
with the Apostle is, so far as we know, the sole cause of their
names appearing<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Charge respecting Laodicea.</div>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, the Laodiceans were closely connected with the
Colossians by local and spiritual ties. To the Church of Laodicea
therefore, and to the household of one Nymphas who
was a prominent member of it, he sends greeting. At the
same time he directs them to interchange letters with the
Laodiceans; for to Laodicea also he had written. And he
closes his salutations with a message to Archippus, a resident
either at Colossæ or at Laodicea (for on this point we are left
to conjecture), who held some important office in the Church,
and respecting whose zeal he seems to have entertained
a misgiving<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. The <span class='sc'>Letter to Philemon</span>.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. But, while providing for the spiritual welfare of the
whole Colossian Church, he did not forget the temporal interests
of its humblest member. Having attended to the solicitations
of the evangelist Epaphras, he addressed himself to
the troubles of the runaway slave Onesimus. The mission of
Tychicus to Colossæ was a favourable opportunity of restoring
him to Philemon; for Tychicus, well known as the Apostle’s
friend and fellow-labourer, might throw the shield of his protection
over him and avert the worst consequences of Philemon’s
anger. But, not content with this measure of precaution,
the Apostle himself writes to <span class='sc'>Philemon</span> on the offender’s behalf,
recommending him as a changed man<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c016'><sup>[118]</sup></a>, and claiming forgiveness
for him as a return due from Philemon to himself
as to his spiritual father<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c016'><sup>[119]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The salutations in this letter are the same as those in
the Epistle to the Colossians with the exception of Jesus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Justus, whose name is omitted<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c016'><sup>[120]</sup></a>. Towards the close St Paul
declares his hope of release and intention of visiting Colossæ,
and asks Philemon to ‘prepare a lodging’ for him<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c016'><sup>[121]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. The <span class='sc'>Circular Letter</span>, of which a copy is sent to <span class='sc'>Laodicea</span>.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. But at the same time with the two letters destined especially
for Colossæ, the Apostle despatched a third, which had
a wider scope. It has been already mentioned that Tychicus
was charged with a mission to the Asiatic Churches. It has
been noticed also that the Colossians were directed to procure
and read a letter in the possession of the Laodiceans. These
two facts are closely connected. The Apostle wrote at this
time a circular letter to the Asiatic Churches, which got
its ultimate designation from the metropolitan city and is
consequently known to us as the Epistle to the <span class='sc'>Ephesians</span><a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c016'><sup>[122]</sup></a>.
It was the immediate object of Tychicus’ journey to deliver
copies of this letter at all the principal centres of Christianity
in the district, and at the same time to communicate
by word of mouth the Apostle’s special messages to each<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c016'><sup>[123]</sup></a>.
Among these centres was Laodicea. Thus his mission brought
him into the immediate neighbourhood of Colossæ. But he
was not charged to deliver another copy of the circular letter
at Colossæ itself, for this Church would be regarded only as
a dependency of Laodicea; and besides he was the bearer
of a special letter from the Apostle to them. It was sufficient
therefore to provide that the Laodicean copy should be circulated
and read at Colossæ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Personal links connecting the three letters.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus the three letters are closely related. Tychicus is the
personal link of connexion between the Epistles to the Ephesians
and to the Colossians; Onesimus between those to the
Colossians and to Philemon.</p>

<p class='c000'>For reasons given elsewhere<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a>, it would appear that these
three letters were written and despatched towards the close of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Earthquake in the Lycus Valley.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>the Apostle’s captivity, about the year 63. At some time not
very distant from this date, a great catastrophe overtook the
cities of the Lycus valley. An earthquake was no uncommon
occurrence in this region<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c016'><sup>[125]</sup></a>. But on this occasion the shock had
been unusually violent, and Laodicea, the flourishing and populous,
was laid in ruins. Tacitus, who is our earliest authority
for this fact, places it in the year 60 and is silent about the
neighbouring towns<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c016'><sup>[126]</sup></a>. Eusebius however makes it subsequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its probable date.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>to the burning of Rome (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 64), and mentions Hierapolis
and Colossæ also as involved in the disaster<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c016'><sup>[127]</sup></a>; while later
writers, adopting the date of Eusebius and including the three
cities with him, represent it as one of a series of divine judgments
on the heathen world for the persecution of the Christians
which followed on the fire<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c016'><sup>[128]</sup></a>. Having no direct knowledge
of the source from which Eusebius derived his information, we
should naturally be disposed to accept the authority of Tacitus
for the date, as more trustworthy. But, as indications occur
elsewhere that Eusebius followed unusually good authorities in
recording these earthquakes<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c016'><sup>[129]</sup></a>, it is far from improbable that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bearing on the chronology of these letters.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
gives the correct date<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c016'><sup>[130]</sup></a>. In this case the catastrophe was subsequent
to the writing of these letters. If on the other hand
the year named by Tacitus be adopted, we gain a subsidiary
confirmation of the comparatively late date which I have ventured
to assign to these epistles on independent grounds; for,
if they had been written two years earlier, when the blow was
recent, we might reasonably have expected to find some reference
to a disaster which had devastated Laodicea and from
which Colossæ cannot have escaped altogether without injury.
The additional fact mentioned by the Roman historian, that
Laodicea was rebuilt from her own resources without the usual
assistance from Rome<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c016'><sup>[131]</sup></a>, is valuable as illustrating a later notice
in the Apostolic writings<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c016'><sup>[132]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Mark’s intended visit.</div>

<p class='c000'>It has been seen that, when these letters were written,
St Mark was intending shortly to visit Colossæ, and that the
Apostle himself, looking forward to his release, hoped at length
to make a personal acquaintance with these Churches, which
hitherto he knew only through the report of others. Whether
St Mark’s visit was ever paid or not, we have no means of
determining<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a>. Of St Paul himself it is reasonable to assume,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>St Paul probably visits Colossæ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that in the interval between his first and second Roman captivity
he found some opportunity of carrying out his design.
At all events we find him at Miletus, near to the mouth of
the Mæander<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c016'><sup>[134]</sup></a>; and the journey between this place and Laodicea
is neither long nor difficult.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St John in Asia Minor.</div>

<p class='c000'>At the time of this visit—the first and last, we may
suppose, which he paid to the valley of the Lycus—St Paul’s
direction of the Asiatic Churches is drawing to a close. With
his death they pass into the hands of St John<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c016'><sup>[135]</sup></a>, who takes up
his abode in Asia Minor. Of Colossæ and Hierapolis we hear
nothing more in the New Testament: but from his exile in<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The message to Laodicea.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Patmos the beloved disciple delivers his Lord’s message to the
Church of Laodicea<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c016'><sup>[136]</sup></a>; a message doubtless intended to be
communicated also to the two subordinate Churches, to which
it would apply almost equally well.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Correspondences between the Apocalypse and St Paul’s Epistles.</div>

<p class='c000'>The message communicated by St John to Laodicea prolongs
the note which was struck by St Paul in the letter to
Colossæ. An interval of a very few years has not materially
altered the character of these Churches. Obviously the same
temper prevails, the same errors are rife, the same correction
must be applied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The doctrine of the Person of Christ,</div>

<p class='c000'>1. Thus, while St Paul finds it necessary to enforce the
truth that Christ is the image of the invisible God, that in
Him all the divine fulness dwells, that He existed before all
things, that through Him all things were created and in Him
all things are sustained, that He is the primary source (ἀρχή)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and has the pre-eminence in all things<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c016'><sup>[137]</sup></a>; so in almost identical
language St John, speaking in the person of our Lord, declares
that He is the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the primary
source (ἀρχή) of the creation of God<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c016'><sup>[138]</sup></a>. Some lingering shreds
of the old heresy, we may suppose, still hung about these
Churches, and instead of ‘holding fast the Head’ they were even
yet prone to substitute intermediate agencies, angelic mediators,
as links in the chain which should bind man to God.
They still failed to realise the majesty and significance, the
<em>completeness</em>, of the Person of Christ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and practical duties which follow upon it.</div>

<p class='c000'>And the practical duty also, which follows from the recognition
of the theological truth, is enforced by both Apostles
in very similar language. If St Paul entreats the Colossians
to seek those things which are above, where Christ is seated on
the right hand of God<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a>, and in the companion epistle, which
also he directs them to read, reminds the Churches that
God raised them with Christ and seated them with him in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c016'><sup>[140]</sup></a>; in like manner St John
gives this promise to the Laodiceans in the name of his Lord:
‘He that overcometh, I will grant to him to sit with me in my
throne, even as I also overcame and did sit with my Father in
His throne<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c016'><sup>[141]</sup></a>’.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Warning against lukewarmness.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. But again; after a parting salutation to the Church of
Laodicea St Paul closes with a warning to Archippus, apparently
its chief pastor, to take heed to his ministry<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c016'><sup>[142]</sup></a>. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>signs of slackened zeal seem to have called forth this rebuke.
It may be an accidental coincidence, but it is at least worthy
of notice, that lukewarmness is the special sin denounced in
the angel of the Laodiceans, and that the necessity of greater
earnestness is the burden of the message to that Church<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a>. As
with the people, so is it with the priest. The community takes
its colour from and communicates its colour to its spiritual
rulers. The ‘be zealous’ of St John is the counterpart to the
‘take heed’ of St Paul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. The pride of wealth denounced.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. Lastly; in the Apocalyptic message the pride of wealth
is sternly condemned in the Laodicean Church: ‘For that thou
sayest I am rich and have gotten me riches and have need
of nothing, and knowest not that thou art utterly wretched
and miserable and beggarly and blind and naked, I counsel
thee to buy gold of me refined with fire, that thou mayest
have riches<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a>.’ This proud vaunt receives its best illustration
from a recent occurrence at Laodicea, to which allusion has
already been made. Only a very few years before this date an
earthquake had laid the city in ruins. Yet from this catastrophe
she rose again with more than her former splendour. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The vaunt of Laodicea.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>This
however was not her chief title to respect. While other cities,
prostrated by a like visitation, had sought relief from the concessions
of the Roman senate or the liberality of the emperor’s
purse, it was the glory of Laodicea that she alone neither
courted nor obtained assistance, but recovered by her own
resources. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Nullo a nobis remedio,’</span> says the Roman historian,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘propriis opibus revaluit<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a>.’</span> Thus she had asserted a
proud independence, to which neither far-famed metropolitan
Ephesus, nor old imperial Sardis, nor her prosperous commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>neighbours, Apamea and Cibyra, could lay claim<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c016'><sup>[146]</sup></a>. No one
would dispute her boast that she ‘had gotten riches and had
need of nothing.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pride of intellectual wealth.</div>

<p class='c000'>But is there not a second and subsidiary idea underlying
the Apocalyptic rebuke? The pride of intellectual wealth,
we may well suspect, was a temptation at Laodicea hardly less
strong than the pride of material resources. When St Paul
wrote, the theology of the Gospel and the comprehension of the
Church were alike endangered by a spirit of intellectual exclusiveness<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c016'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
in these cities. He warned them against a vain
philosophy, against a show of wisdom, against an intrusive
mystic speculation, which vainly puffed up the fleshly mind<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c016'><sup>[148]</sup></a>.
He tacitly contrasted with this false intellectual wealth ‘the
riches of the glory of God’s mystery revealed in Christ<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a>,’ the
riches of the full assurance of understanding, the genuine treasures
of wisdom and knowledge<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c016'><sup>[150]</sup></a>. May not the same contrast
be discerned in the language of St John? The Laodiceans
boast of their enlightenment, but they are blind, and to cure
their blindness they must seek eye-salve from the hands of the
great Physician. They vaunt their wealth of knowledge, but
they are wretched paupers, and must beg the refined gold of
the Gospel to relieve their wants<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the last notice in the Apostolic records relating to
the Churches in the valley of the Lycus; but during the succeeding
ages the Christian communities of this district play
a conspicuous part in the struggles and the development of the
Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The early disciples settle in proconsular Asia<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>When after the destruction of Jerusalem St John

the oldest surviving members of the Palestinian Church accompanied
him into ‘Asia,’ which henceforward became the
head-quarters of Apostolic authority. In this body of emigrants
Andrew<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a> and Philip among the Twelve, Aristion and
John the presbyter<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a> among other personal disciples of the
Lord, are especially mentioned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and especially at Hierapolis.</div>

<p class='c000'>Among the chief settlements of this Christian dispersion was
Hierapolis. This fact explains how these Phrygian Churches
assumed a prominence in the ecclesiastical history of the second
century, for which we are hardly prepared by their antecedents
as they appear in connexion with St Paul, and which they
failed to maintain in the history of the later Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here at all events was settled Philip of Bethsaida<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Philip the Apostle with his daughters.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
early friend and fellow-townsman of St John, and the first
Apostle who is recorded to have held communication with
the Gentiles<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c016'><sup>[155]</sup></a>. Here he died and was buried; and here after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>his decease lived his two virgin daughters, who survived to a
very advanced age and thus handed down to the second century
the traditions of the earliest days of the Church. A third
daughter, who was married, had settled in Ephesus, where
her body rested<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c016'><sup>[156]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their traditions collected by Papias.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>It was from the two daughters who resided

preachers of the Gospel, which he transmitted to posterity in
his work<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c016'><sup>[157]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Papias had conversed not only with the daughters
of Philip, but also with at least two personal disciples of the
Lord, Aristion and John the presbyter. He made it his business
to gather traditions respecting the sayings of the Saviour
and His Apostles; and he published a work in five books,
entitled <cite>An Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord</cite>, using the
information thus collected to illustrate the discourses, and
perhaps the doings, of Christ as recorded in the Gospels<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c016'><sup>[158]</sup></a>.
Among other stories he related, apparently on the authority
of these daughters of Philip, how a certain dead man had been
restored to life in his own day, and how Justus Barsabas, who
is mentioned in the Acts, had drunk a deadly poison and miraculously
escaped from any evil effects<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c016'><sup>[159]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Life and teaching of <span class='sc'>Papias</span>.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>If we may judge by his name, <span class='sc'>Papias</span> was a native of
Phrygia, probably of Hierapolis<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c016'><sup>[160]</sup></a>, of which he afterwards became
bishop, and must have grown up to youth or early manhood
before the close of the first century. He is said to have
suffered martyrdom at Pergamum about the year 165; but
there is good reason for distrusting this statement, independently
of any chronological difficulty which it involves<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c016'><sup>[161]</sup></a>. Otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Account of Eusebius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>he must have lived to a very advanced age. Eusebius, to
whom chiefly we owe our information respecting him, was
repelled by his millennarian views, and describes him as a man
of mean intelligence<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c016'><sup>[162]</sup></a>, accusing him of misunderstanding the
Apostolic sayings respecting the kingdom of Christ and thus
interpreting in a material sense expressions which were intended
to be mystical and symbolical. This disparaging account,
though one-sided, was indeed not altogether undeserved, for
his love of the marvellous seems to have overpowered his
faculty of discrimination. But the adverse verdict of Eusebius
must be corrected by the more sympathetic language of Irenæus<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c016'><sup>[163]</sup></a>,
who possibly may have known him personally, and who
certainly must have been well acquainted with his reputation
and character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much has been written respecting the relation of this
writer to the Canonical Gospels, but the discussion has no very
direct bearing on our special subject, and may be dismissed
here<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c016'><sup>[164]</sup></a>. One question however, which has a real importance
as affecting the progress of the Gospel in these parts, has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>raised by modern criticism and must not be passed over in
silence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A modern hypothesis respecting Christianity in Asia Minor stated and discussed.</div>

<p class='c000'>It has been supposed that there was an entire dislocation
and discontinuity in the history of Christianity in Asia Minor
at a certain epoch; that the Apostle of the Gentiles was
ignored and his teaching repudiated, if not anathematized;
and that on its ruins was erected the standard of Judaism,
around which with a marvellous unanimity deserters from the
Pauline Gospel rallied. Of this retrograde faith St John is
supposed to have been the great champion, and Papias a
typical and important representative<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c016'><sup>[165]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject, as a whole, is too wide for a full investigation
here. I must content myself with occupying a limited area,
showing not only the historical baselessness, but the strong
inherent improbability of the theory, as applied to Hierapolis
and the neighbouring churches. As this district is its chief
strong-hold, a repulse at this point must involve its ultimate
defeat along the whole line.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The position of St John</div>

<p class='c000'>Of St John himself I have already spoken<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c016'><sup>[166]</sup></a>.  It has been
shown that his language addressed to these Churches is not
only not opposed to St Paul’s teaching, but presents remarkable
coincidences with it. So far at least the theory finds no
support; and, when from St John we turn to Papias, the case
is not different. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and of Papias.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The advocates of the hypothesis in question
lay the chief stress of their argument on the silence of Papias,
or rather of Eusebius. Eusebius quotes a passage from Papias,
in which the bishop of Hierapolis mentions collecting from
trustworthy sources the sayings of certain Apostles and early
disciples; but St Paul is not named among them. He also
gives short extracts from Papias referring to the Gospels of
St Matthew and St Mark, and mentions that this writer made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>use of the first Epistle of St John and the first Epistle of St
Peter; but here again there is no allusion to St Paul’s writings.
Whether referring to the personal testimony or to the Canonical
writings of the Apostles, Papias, we are reminded, is
equally silent about St Paul.</p>

<p class='c000'>On both these points a satisfactory answer can be given;
but the two cases are essentially different, and must be considered
apart.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The traditions collected by Papias.</div>

<p class='c000'>(1) The range of <em>personal testimony</em> which Papias would be
able to collect depended on his opportunities. Before he had
grown up to manhood, the personal reminiscences of St Paul
would have almost died out. The Apostle of the Gentiles had
not resided more than three years even at Ephesus, and seems
to have paid only one brief visit to the valley of the Lycus, even
if he visited it at all. Such recollections of St Paul as might
once have lingered here would certainly be overshadowed by
and forgotten in the later sojourn of St John, which, beginning
where they ceased, extended over more than a quarter of a century.
To St John, and to those personal disciples of Christ who
surrounded him, Papias and his contemporaries would naturally
and almost inevitably look for the traditions which they so
eagerly collected. This is the case with the leading representative
of the Asiatic school in the next generation, Irenæus,
whose traditions are almost wholly derived from St John and
his companions, while at the same time he evinces an entire
sympathy with the work and teaching of St Paul. But indeed,
even if it had been otherwise, the object which Papias had
directly in view did not suggest any appeal to St Paul’s
authority. He was writing an ‘Exposition of the Oracles of the
Lord,’ and he sought to supplement and interpret these by
traditions of our Lord’s life, such as eyewitnesses only could
give. St Paul could have no place among those personal
disciples of Christ, of whom alone he is speaking in this preface
to his work, which Eusebius quotes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. His references to the Canonical writings.</div>

<p class='c000'>(2) But, though we have no right to expect any mention
of St Paul where the appeal is to personal testimony, yet with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>quotations from or references to the <em>Canonical writings</em>
the case, it may be argued, is different. Here at all events we
might look for some recognition of St Paul. To this argument
it would perhaps be a sufficient reply, that St Paul’s Epistles
do not furnish any matter which must necessarily have been
introduced into a work such as Papias composed. But the
complete and decisive answer is this; that the silence of Eusebius,
so far from carrying with it the silence of Papias, does not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>No weight to be attached to the silence of Eusebius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
even afford a presumption in this direction. Papias may have
quoted St Paul again and again, and yet Eusebius would see
no reason to chronicle the fact. His usage in other cases is
decisive on this point. The Epistle of Polycarp which was
read by Eusebius is the same which we still possess. Not
only does it teem with the most obvious quotations from St
Paul, but in one passage it directly mentions his writing to the
Philippians<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c016'><sup>[167]</sup></a>. Yet the historian, describing its relation to the
Canonical Scriptures, contents himself with saying that it ‘employs
some testimonies from the former Epistle of Peter<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c016'><sup>[168]</sup></a>.’
Exactly similar is his language respecting Irenæus also. Irenæus,
as is well known, cites by name almost every one of St
Paul’s Epistles; yet the description which Eusebius gives under
this same head, after quoting this writer’s notices respecting
the history of the Gospels and the Apocalypse, is that ‘he
mentions also the first Epistle of John, alleging very many
testimonies from it, and in like manner also the former Epistle
of Peter<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c016'><sup>[169]</sup></a>.’ There is every reason therefore to suppose that
Eusebius would deal with Papias as he has dealt with Polycarp
and Irenæus, and that, unless Papias had introduced some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>curious fact relating to St Paul, it would not have occurred
to him to record mere quotations from or references to this
Apostle’s letters. It may be supposed that Eusebius records
with a fair amount of attention references to the Catholic
Epistles in early writers, because the limits of the Canon in
this part were not accurately fixed. On the other hand the
Epistles of St Paul were universally received and therefore
did not need to be accredited by any such testimony. But
whatever may be the explanation, the fact is patent, and it
furnishes a complete answer to the argument drawn from his
silence in the case of Papias<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c016'><sup>[170]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The views of Papias inferred from his associates.</div>

<p class='c000'>But, if the assumption has been proved to be baseless, have
we any grounds for saying that it is also highly improbable?
Here it seems fair to argue from the well-known to the unknown.
Of the opinions of Papias respecting St Paul we know
absolutely nothing; of the opinions of Polycarp and Irenæus
ample evidence lies before us. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Noscitur a sociis</em></span> is a sound
maxim to apply in such a case. Papias was a companion of
Polycarp, and he is quoted with deference by Irenæus<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c016'><sup>[171]</sup></a>. Is it
probable that his opinions should be diametrically opposed to
those of his friend and contemporary on a cardinal point affecting
the very conception of Christianity (for the rejection of
St Paul must be considered in this light)? or that this vital
heterodoxy, if it existed, should have escaped an intelligent
critic of the next generation who had the five books of his
work before him, who himself had passed his early life in Asia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Minor, and who yet appeals to Papias as preserving the doctrinal
tradition which had been handed down from the Apostles
themselves to his own time? I say nothing of Eusebius himself,
who, with a distinct prejudice against Papias, accuses him
of no worse heresy in his writings than entertaining millennarian
views.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Millennarian views consistent with the recognition of St Paul.</div>

<p class='c000'>It may indeed be confessed that a man like Papias, whose
natural bent, assisted by his Phrygian education, was towards
sensuous views of religion, would not be likely to appreciate the
essentially spiritual teaching of St Paul; but this proves nothing.
The difference between unconscious want of sympathy and conscious
rejection is all important for the matter in hand. The
same charge might be brought against numberless theologians,
whether in the middle ages or in more modern times, into whose
minds it never entered to question the authority of the Apostle
and who quote his writings with the utmost reverence. Neither
in the primitive days of Christianity nor in its later
stages has the profession of Chiliastic views been found inconsistent
with the fullest recognition of St Paul’s Apostolic
claims. In the early Church Irenæus and Tertullian are
notable instances of this combination; and in our own age and
country a tendency to millennarian speculations has been commonly
associated with the staunchest adherence to the fundamental
doctrines of St Paul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Abercius</span> probably his successor.</div>

<p class='c000'>As the  successor of Papias and the predecessor of Claudius
Apollinaris in the see of Hierapolis, we may perhaps name
<span class='sc'>Abercius</span> or <span class='sc'>Avircius</span><a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c016'><sup>[172]</sup></a>. His legendary Acts assign his episcopate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to the  reign of Marcus Aurelius; and, though they
are disfigured by extravagant fictions, yet the date may perhaps
be accepted, as it seems to be confirmed by other evidence.
An inscription on his tombstone recorded how he had paid one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>His journeys.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
visit to the city of Rome, and another to the banks of the
Euphrates.  These long journeys are not without parallels in
the lives of contemporary bishops. Polycarp of Smyrna visited
Rome, hoping to adjust the Paschal controversy; Melito of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Sardis went as far as Palestine, desiring to ascertain on the spot
the facts relating to the Canon of the Old Testament Scriptures.
These or similar motives may have influenced Abercius to
undertake his distant journeys. If we may assume the identification
of this bishop with one Avircius Marcellus who is mentioned
in a contemporary document, he took an active interest
in the Montanist controversy, as from his position he was
likely to do.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Claudius Apollinaris</span> bishop of Hierapolis.</div>

<p class='c000'>The literary character of the see of Hierapolis, which had
been inaugurated by Papias, was ably sustained by <span class='sc'>Claudius
Apollinaris</span>. His surname, which seems to have been common
in these parts<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c016'><sup>[173]</sup></a>, may have been derived from the patron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>deity of Hierapolis<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c016'><sup>[174]</sup></a> and suggests a Gentile origin. His intimate
acquaintance with heathen literature, which is mentioned
by more than one ancient writer, points in the same direction.
During the reign of M. Aurelius he had already made himself a
name by his writings, and seems to have been promoted to the
see of Hierapolis before the death of that emperor<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c016'><sup>[175]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His literary works.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of his works, which were very numerous, only a few scanty
fragments have survived<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c016'><sup>[176]</sup></a>. The imperfect lists however, which
have reached us, bear ample testimony both to the literary
activity of the man, and to the prominence of the Church, over
which he presided, in the great theological and ecclesiastical
controversies of the age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>He takes part in the two chief controversies of the day.</div>

<p class='c000'>The two questions, which especially agitated the Churches
of Asia Minor during the last thirty years of the first century,
were the celebration of the Easter festival and the pretensions
of the Montanist prophets. In both disputes Claudius Apollinaris
took an active and conspicuous part.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The Paschal question.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The Paschal controversy, after smouldering long both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>here and elsewhere, first burst into flames in the neighbouring
Church of Laodicea<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c016'><sup>[178]</sup></a>. An able bishop of Hierapolis therefore
must necessarily have been involved in the dispute, even if he
had been desirous of avoiding it. What side Apollinaris took
in the controversy the extant fragments of his work do not
by themselves enable us to decide; for they deal merely with a
subsidiary question which does not seriously affect the main
issue<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c016'><sup>[179]</sup></a>. But we can hardly doubt that with Polycarp of
Smyrna and Melito of Sardis and Polycrates of Ephesus he
defended the practice which was universal in Asia<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c016'><sup>[180]</sup></a>, observing
the Paschal anniversary on the 14th Nisan whether it fell on a
Friday or not, and invoking the authority of St John at Ephesus,
and of St Philip at his own Hierapolis<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c016'><sup>[181]</sup></a>, against the divergent
usage of Alexandria and Palestine and the West.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Montanism.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. His writings on the Montanist controversy were still
more famous, and are recommended as an authority on the
subject by Serapion of Antioch a few years after the author’s
death<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c016'><sup>[182]</sup></a>. Though later than many of his works<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c016'><sup>[183]</sup></a>, they were
written soon after Montanus had divulged the extravagance of
his pretensions and before Montanism had attained its complete
development. If a later notice may be trusted, Apollinaris was
not satisfied with attacking Montanism in writing, but summoned
at Hierapolis a council of twenty-six bishops besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>himself, where this heresy was condemned and sentence of
excommunication pronounced against Montanus together with
his adherent the pretended prophetess Maximilla<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c016'><sup>[184]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His other hæresiological writings.</div>

<p class='c000'>Nor were his controversial writings confined to these two
topics. In one place he refuted the Encratites<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c016'><sup>[185]</sup></a>; in another he
upheld the orthodox teaching respecting the true humanity of
Christ<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c016'><sup>[186]</sup></a>. It is plain that he did not confine himself to questions
especially affecting Asia Minor; but that the doctrine and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>practice of the Church generally found in him a vigorous advocate,
who was equally opposed to the novelties of heretical
teaching and the rigours of overstrained asceticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor again did Apollinaris restrict himself to controversies
carried on between Christian and Christian. He appears alike
as the champion of the Gospel against attacks from without,
and as the promoter of Christian life and devotion within the
pale of the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>His apologetic<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the one hand he was the author of an
apology addressed to M. Aurelius<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c016'><sup>[187]</sup></a>, of a controversial treatise in
five books against the Greeks, and of a second in two books
against the Jews<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c016'><sup>[188]</sup></a>; on the other we find mentioned among his
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and didactic works.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
writings a work in two books <cite>on Truth</cite>, and a second <cite>on Piety</cite>,
besides several of which the titles have not come down to us<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c016'><sup>[189]</sup></a>.
He seems indeed to have written on almost every subject which
interested the Church of his age. He was not only well versed
in the Scriptures, but showed a wide acquaintance with secular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>literature also<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c016'><sup>[190]</sup></a>. His style is praised by a competent judge<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c016'><sup>[191]</sup></a>,
and his orthodoxy was such as to satisfy the dogmatic precision
of the post-Nicene age<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c016'><sup>[192]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Important bearing of these facts on the history of Christianity.</div>

<p class='c000'>These facts are not unimportant in their bearing on the
question which has been already discussed in relation to Papias.
If there had been such a discontinuity of doctrine and practice
in the Church of Hierapolis as the theory in question assumes,
if the Pauline Gospel was repudiated in the later years of the
first century and rank Judaism adopted in its stead, how can we
explain the position of Apollinaris? Obviously a counter-revolution
must have taken place, which undid the effects of the
former. One dislocation must have been compensated by another.
And yet Irenæus knows nothing of these religious convulsions
which must have shaken the doctrine of the Church to its
foundations, but represents the tradition as one, continuous,
unbroken, reaching back through the elders of the Asiatic
Churches, through Papias and Polycarp, to St John himself—Irenæus
who received his Christian education in Asia Minor,
who throughout life was in communication with the churches
there, and who had already reached middle age when this second
revolution is supposed to have occurred. The demands on
our credulity, which this theory makes, are enormous. And
its improbability becomes only the more glaring, as we extend
our view.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Solidarity of the Church in the second century.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For the <em>solidarity</em> of the Church is the one striking
fact unmistakably revealed to us, as here and there the veil
which shrouds the history of the second century is lifted.
Anicetus and Soter and Eleutherus and Victor at Rome, Pantænus
and Clement at Alexandria, Polycrates at Ephesus, Papias
and Apollinaris at Hierapolis, Polycarp at Smyrna, Melito at
Sardis, Ignatius and Serapion at Antioch, Primus and Dionysius
at Corinth, Pothinus and Irenæus in Gaul, Philippus and Pinytus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>in Crete, Hegesippus and Narcissus in Palestine, all are
bound together by the ties of a common organization and the
sympathy of a common creed. The Paschal controversy is
especially valuable, as showing the limits of divergence consistent
with the unity of the Church. The study of this controversy
teaches us to appreciate with ever increasing force the
pregnant saying of Irenæus that the difference of the usage
establishes the harmony of the faith<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c016'><sup>[193]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Activity of Laodicea.</div>

<p class='c000'>Though Laodicea cannot show the same intellectual activity
as Hierapolis during the second century, yet in practical
energy she is not wanting.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Martyrdom of Sagaris. c. <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 165.</div>

<p class='c000'>The same persecution, which, permitted if not encouraged
by the imperial Stoic, was fatal to Polycarp at Smyrna, deprived
Laodicea also of her bishop Sagaris<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c016'><sup>[194]</sup></a>. The exact year in which
he fell a martyr is not known; but we can hardly be wrong in
assuming that his death was nearly coincident with those of
Polycarp and his companions. His name appears to have been
held in great honour<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c016'><sup>[195]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Outbreak of the Paschal controversy.</div>

<p class='c000'>But while the Church of Laodicea was thus contending
against foes without, she was also torn asunder by feuds within.
Coincident with the martyrdom of Sagaris was the outburst of
the Paschal controversy, of which mention has been already
made, and which for more than a century and a half disturbed
the peace of the Church, until it was finally laid at rest by the
Council of Nicæa. The Laodiceans would naturally regulate
their festival by the Asiatic or Quartodeciman usage, strictly
observing the day of the month and disregarding the day of
the week. But a great commercial centre like Laodicea must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>have attracted large crowds of foreign Christians from Palestine
or Egypt or Rome or Gaul, who were accustomed to commemorate
the Passion always on a Friday and the Resurrection on a
Sunday according to the western practice; and in this way probably
the dispute arose. The treatise <cite>on the Paschal Festival</cite>
by Melito of Sardis was written on this occasion to defend the
Asiatic practice. The fact that Laodicea became the head-quarters
of the controversy is a speaking testimony to the
prominence of this Church in the latter half of the second
century.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hierapolis and Laodicea in later history.</div>

<p class='c000'>At a later date the influence of both Hierapolis and Laodicea
has sensibly declined. In the great controversies of the fourth                          s
and fifth centuries they take no conspicuous part. Among
their bishops there is not one who has left his mark on history.
And yet their names appear at most of the great Councils,
in which they bear a silent part. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <em>Arian</em> heresy. <br/> <span class='sc'>Nicæa</span> <br/> <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 325.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>At Nicæa Hierapolis was
represented by Flaccus<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c016'><sup>[196]</sup></a>, Laodicea by Nunechius<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c016'><sup>[197]</sup></a>. They both
acquiesced in its decrees, and the latter as metropolitan published
them throughout the Phrygian Churches<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c016'><sup>[198]</sup></a>. Soon after, both
sees lapsed into Arianism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Philippopolis <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 347.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At the synod of Philippopolis,
composed of bishops who had seceded from the Council of Sardica,
the representatives of these two sees were present and
joined in the condemnation of the Athanasians. On this occasion
Hierapolis was still represented by Flaccus, who had thus
turned traitor to his former faith<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c016'><sup>[199]</sup></a>. On the other hand Laodicea
had changed its bishop twice meanwhile. Cecropius had won the
imperial favour by his abuse of the orthodox party, and was first
promoted to Laodicea, whence he was translated to Nicomedia<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c016'><sup>[200]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>He was succeeded by Nonnius, who signed the Arian decree at
Philippopolis<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c016'><sup>[201]</sup></a>. When these sees recovered their orthodoxy we
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Constantinople.</span> <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 381.]<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
do not know; but it is perhaps a significant fact, that neither
is represented at the second general Council, held at Constantinople
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <em>Nestorian</em> and <em>Eutychian</em> heresies. <br/> <span class='sc'>Ephesus.</span> <br/> <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 431.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 381)<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c016'><sup>[202]</sup></a>. At the third general Council, which met at
Ephesus, Laodicea is represented by Aristonicus, Hierapolis
by Venantius<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c016'><sup>[203]</sup></a>. Both bishops sign the decrees condemning
Nestorius. Again in the next Christological controversy which
agitated the Church the two sees bear their part. At the notorious
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Latrocinium. <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 449.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Robbers’ Synod, held also at Ephesus, Laodicea was
represented by another Nunechius, Hierapolis by Stephanus.
Both bishops committed themselves to the policy of Dioscorus
and the opinions of the heretic Eutyches<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c016'><sup>[204]</sup></a>. Yet with the fickleness
which characterized these sees at an earlier date during
the Arian controversy, we find their representatives two years
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Chalcedon.</span> <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 451.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
later at the Council of Chalcedon siding with the orthodox
party and condemning the Eutychian heresy which they had
so lately supported<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c016'><sup>[205]</sup></a>. Nunechius is still bishop of Laodicea,
and reverses his former vote. Stephanus has been succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>at Hierapolis by Abercius, whose orthodoxy, so far as we know,
had not been compromised by any previous expression of
opinion<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c016'><sup>[206]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Later vacillation of these sees.</div>

<p class='c000'>The history of these churches at a later date is such as
might have been anticipated from their attitude during the
period of the first Four General Councils. The sees of Laodicea
and Hierapolis, one or both, are represented at all the more
important assemblies of the Church; and the same vacillation
and infirmity of purpose, which had characterized their holders
in the earlier councils, marks the proceedings of their later successors<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c016'><sup>[207]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their comparative unimportance.</div>

<p class='c000'>But, though the two sees thus continue to bear witness to
their existence by the repeated presence of their occupants at
councils and synods, yet the real influence of Laodicea and
Hierapolis on the Church at large has terminated with the
close of the second century. On one occasion only did either
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Council of Laodicea</span> an exception.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
community assume a position of prominence. About the middle
of the fourth century a council was held at Laodicea<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c016'><sup>[208]</sup></a>. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its decree on the Canon.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was convened more especially to settle some points of ecclesiastical
discipline; but incidentally the assembled bishops were
led to make an order respecting the Canon of Scripture<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c016'><sup>[209]</sup></a>. As
this was the first occasion in which the subject had been
brought formally before the notice of an ecclesiastical assembly
this Council of Laodicea secured a notoriety which it would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>otherwise have obtained, and to which it was hardly entitled
by its constitution or its proceedings. Its decrees were confirmed
and adopted by later councils both in the East and in
the West<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c016'><sup>[210]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its decrees illustrate the Epistle to the Colossians.</div>

<p class='c000'>More important however for my special purpose, than the
influence of this synod on the Church at large, is the light
which its canons throw on the heretical tendencies of this
district, and on the warnings of St Paul in the Colossian
Epistle. To illustrate this fact it will only be necessary to
write out some of these canons at length:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Col. ii. 14, 16, 17.</div>

<p class='c000'>29. ‘It is not right for Christians to Judaize and abstain
from labour on the sabbath, but to work on this same day.
They should pay respect rather to the Lord’s day, and, if
possible, abstain from labour on it as Christians. But if they
should be found Judaizers, let them be anathema in the sight
of Christ.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Col. ii. 18.</div>

<p class='c000'>35. ‘It is not right for Christians to abandon the Church
of God and go away and invoke angels (ἀγγέλους ὀνομάζειν)<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c016'><sup>[211]</sup></a>
and hold conventicles (συνάξεις ποιεῖν); for these things are
forbidden. If therefore any one is found devoting himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to this secret idolatry, let him be anathema, because he abandoned
our Lord Jesus Christ and went after idolatry.’</p>

<p class='c000'>36. ‘It is not right for priests or clergy to be magicians
or enchanters or mathematicians or astrologers<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c016'><sup>[212]</sup></a>, or to make
safe-guards (φυλακτήρια) as they are called, for such things are
prisons (δεσμωτήρια) of their souls<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c016'><sup>[213]</sup></a>: and we have enjoined
that they which wear them be cast out of the Church.’</p>

<p class='c000'>37. ‘It is not right to receive from Jews or heretics the
festive offerings which they send about, nor to join in their
festivals.’</p>

<p class='c000'>38. ‘It is not right to receive unleavened bread from the
Jews or to participate in their impieties.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It is strange, at this late date, to find still lingering in these
churches the same readiness to be ‘judged in respect of an
holiday or a new moon or a sabbath,’ with the same tendency
to relinquish the hold of the Head and to substitute ‘a voluntary
humility and worshipping of angels,’ which three centuries
before had called forth the Apostle’s rebuke and warning in the
Epistle to the Colossians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ecclesiastical status of Laodicea and Hierapolis.</div>

<p class='c000'>During the flourishing period of the Eastern Church, Laodicea
appears as the metropolis of the province of Phrygia
Pacatiana, counting among its suffragan bishoprics the see of
Colossæ<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c016'><sup>[214]</sup></a>. On the other hand Hierapolis, though only six
miles distant, belonged to the neighbouring province of Phrygia
Salutaris<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c016'><sup>[215]</sup></a>, whose metropolis was Synnada, and of which it was
one of the most important sees. The stream of the Lycus
seems to have formed the boundary line between the two
ecclesiastical provinces. At a later date Hierapolis itself was
raised to metropolitan rank<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c016'><sup>[216]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Obscurity of Colossæ.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>But while Laodicea and Hierapolis held the foremost place
in the records of the early Church, and continued to bear an
active, though inconspicuous part, in later Christian history,
Colossæ was from the very first a cipher. The town itself, as
we have seen, was already waning in importance, when the
Apostle wrote; and its subsequent decline seems to have been
rapid. Not a single event in Christian history is connected
with its name; and its very existence is only rescued from
oblivion, when at long intervals some bishop of Colossæ attaches
his signature to the decree of an ecclesiastical synod.
The city ceased to strike coins in the reign of Gordian (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>It is supplanted by Chonæ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
238–244)<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c016'><sup>[217]</sup></a>. It fell gradually into decay, being supplanted by
the neighbouring town Chonæ, the modern Chonos, so called
from the natural funnels by which the streams here disappear
in underground channels formed by the incrustations of travertine<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c016'><sup>[218]</sup></a>.
We may conjecture also that its ruin was hastened by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>a renewed assault of its ancient enemy, the earthquake<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c016'><sup>[219]</sup></a>. It is
commonly said that Chonæ is built on the site of the ancient
Colossæ; but the later town stands at some distance from the
earlier, as Salisbury does from Old Sarum. The episcopal
see necessarily followed the population; though for some time
after its removal to the new town the bishop still continued
to use the older title, with or without the addition of Chonæ
by way of explanation, till at length the name of this primitive
Apostolic Church passes wholly out of sight<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c016'><sup>[220]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Turkish conquest.</div>

<p class='c000'>The  Turkish conquest pressed with more than common
severity on these districts.  When the day of visitation came,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the Church was taken by surprise. Occupied with ignoble
quarrels and selfish interests, she had no ear for the voice of
Him who demanded admission. The door was barred and
the knock unheeded. The long-impending doom overtook
her, and the golden candlestick was removed for ever from the
Eternal Presence<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c016'><sup>[221]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h2 id='chap02' class='c009'>II. <br /> THE COLOSSIAN HERESY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c015'>Two elements in the Colossian heresy.</div>

<p class='c000'>From the language of St Paul, addressed to the Church
of Colossæ, we may infer the presence of two disturbing
elements which threatened the purity of Christian faith and
practice in this community.  These elements are distinguishable
in themselves, though it does not follow that they present
the teaching of two distinct parties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. <span class='sc'>Judaic.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>1. A mere glance at the epistle suffices to detect the
presence of <span class='sc'>Judaism</span> in the teaching which the Apostle combats.
The observance of sabbaths and new moons is decisive in
this respect. The distinction of meats and drinks points in the
same direction<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c016'><sup>[222]</sup></a>. Even the enforcement of the initiatory rite
of Judaism may be inferred from the contrast implied in
St Paul’s recommendation of the spiritual circumcision<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c016'><sup>[223]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. <span class='sc'>Gnostic.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>2. On the other hand a closer examination of its language
shows that these Judaic features do not exhaust the portraiture
of the heresy or heresies against which the epistle is
directed. We discern an element of theosophic speculation,
which is alien to the spirit of Judaism proper. We are confronted
with a shadowy mysticism, which loses itself in the
contemplation of the unseen world.  We discover a tendency
to interpose certain spiritual agencies, intermediate beings,
between God and man, as the instruments of communication
and the objects of worship<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c016'><sup>[224]</sup></a>. Anticipating the result which
will appear more clearly hereafter, we may say that along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>with its Judaism there was a <span class='sc'>Gnostic</span> element in the false
teaching which prevailed at Colossæ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Are these combined or separate?</div>

<p class='c000'>Have we then two heresies here, or one only?  Were
these elements distinct, or were they fused into the same
system? In other words, Is St Paul controverting a phase
of Judaism on the one hand, and a phase of Gnosticism on
the other; or did he find himself in conflict with a Judæo-Gnostic
heresy which combined the two<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c016'><sup>[225]</sup></a>?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General reasons for supposing one heresy only, in which they are fused.</div>

<p class='c000'>On closer examination we find ourselves compelled to
adopt the latter alternative. The epistle itself contains no
hint that the Apostle has more than one set of antagonists
in view; and the needless multiplication of persons or events
is always to be deprecated in historical criticism. Nor indeed
does the hypothesis of a single complex heresy present any real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>difficulty. If the two elements seem irreconcileable, or at least
incongruous, at first sight, the incongruity disappears on further
examination. It will be shown in the course of this investigation,
that some special tendencies of religious thought among
the Jews themselves before and about this time prepared the
way for such a combination in a Christian community like
the Church of Colossæ<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c016'><sup>[226]</sup></a>. Moreover we shall find that the Christian
heresies of the next succeeding ages exhibit in a more
developed form the same complex type, which here appears in
its nascent state<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c016'><sup>[227]</sup></a>; this later development not only showing
that the combination was historically possible in itself, but
likewise presupposing some earlier stage of its existence such
as confronts us at Colossæ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>S. Paul’s language is decisive on this point.</div>

<p class='c000'>But in fact the Apostle’s language hardly leaves the question
open. The two elements are so closely interwoven in
his refutation, that it is impossible to separate them. He
passes backwards and forwards from the one to the other
in such a way as to show that they are only parts of one
complex whole. On this point the logical connexion of the
sentences is decisive: ‘Beware lest any man make spoil of
you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of
men, after the rudiments of the world.... Ye were circumcised
with a circumcision not made with hands.... And you ... did He
quicken, ... blotting out the handwriting of ordinances which
was against you.... Let no man therefore judge you in meat
or drink, or in respect of a holy day or a new moon or a
sabbath.... Let no man beguile you of your prize in a self-imposed
humility and service of angels.... If ye died with Christ
from the rudiments of the world, why ... are ye subject to
ordinances ... which things have a show of wisdom in self-imposed
service and humility and hard treatment of the body,
but are of no value against indulgence  of the flesh<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c016'><sup>[228]</sup></a>.’ Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the superior wisdom, the speculative element which is characteristic
of Gnosticism, and the ritual observance, the practical
element which was supplied by Judaism, are regarded not only
as springing from the same stem, but also as intertwined in
their growth. And the more carefully we examine the sequence
of the Apostle’s thoughts, the more intimate will the connexion
appear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gnosticism must be defined and described.</div>

<p class='c000'>Having described the speculative element in this complex
heresy provisionally as Gnostic, I purpose enquiring in the first
place, how far Judaism prior to and independently of Christianity
had allied itself with Gnostic modes of thought; and
afterwards, whether the description of the Colossian heresy is
such as to justify us in thus classing it as a species of Gnosticism.
But, as a preliminary to these enquiries, some definition of
the word, or at least some conception of the leading ideas
which it involves, will be necessary. With its complex varieties
and elaborate developments we have no concern here:
for, if Gnosticism can be found at all in the records of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Apostolic age, it will obviously appear in a simple and elementary
form. Divested of its accessories and presented in its
barest outline, it is not difficult of delineation<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c016'><sup>[229]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. Intellectual exclusiveness of Gnosticism.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. As the name attests<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c016'><sup>[230]</sup></a>, Gnosticism implies the possession
of a superior wisdom, which is hidden from others. It makes a
distinction between the select few who have this higher gift,
and the vulgar many who are without it. Faith, blind faith,
suffices the latter, while knowledge is the exclusive possession
of the former. Thus it recognises a separation of intellectual
<em>caste</em> in religion, introducing the distinction of an esoteric
and an exoteric doctrine, and interposing an initiation of some
kind or other between the two classes. In short it is animated
by the exclusive <em>aristocratic</em> spirit<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c016'><sup>[231]</sup></a>, which distinguishes the
ancient religions, and from which it was a main function of
Christianity to deliver mankind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Speculative tenets of Gnosticism.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. This was its spirit; and the intellectual questions, on
which its energies were concentrated and to which it professed
to hold the key, were mainly twofold. How can the work of
creation be explained? and, How are we to account for the existence
of evil<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c016'><sup>[232]</sup></a>? To reconcile the creation of the world and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Creation of the world, and existence of evil.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the existence of evil with the conception of God as the absolute
Being, was the problem which all the Gnostic systems set
themselves to solve. It will be seen that the two questions
cannot be treated independently but have a very close and
intimate connexion with each other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Existence of evil, how to be explained?</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The Gnostic argument ran as follows: Did God create the
world out of nothing, evolve it from Himself? Then, God
being perfectly good and creation having resulted from His
sole act without any opposing or modifying influence, evil
would have been impossible; for otherwise we are driven to
the conclusion that God created evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matter the abode of evil.</div>

<p class='c000'>This solution being rejected as impossible, the Gnostic was
obliged to postulate some antagonistic principle independent
of God, by which His creative energy was thwarted and limited.
This opposing principle, the kingdom of evil, he conceived to
be the world of matter. The precise idea of its mode of
operation varies in different Gnostic systems. It is sometimes
regarded as a dead passive resistance, sometimes as a turbulent
active power. But, though the exact point of view may shift,
the object contemplated is always the same. In some way or
other evil is regarded as residing in the material, sensible
world. Thus Gnostic speculation on the existence of evil ends
in a dualism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Creation, how to be explained?</div>

<p class='c000'>This point being conceded, the ulterior question arises:
How then is creation possible? How can the Infinite communicate
with the Finite, the Good with the Evil? How can
God act upon matter? God is perfect, absolute, incomprehensible.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, the Gnostic went on to argue, could only have been
possible by some self-limitation on the part of God. God must
express Himself in some way. There must be some evolution,
some effluence, of Deity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Doctrine of emanations.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus the Divine Being germinates, as
it were; and the first germination again evolves a second from
itself in like manner. In this way we obtain a series of successive
emanations, which may be more or fewer, as the requirements
of any particular system demand. In each successive evolution
the Divine element is feebler. They sink gradually lower and
lower in the scale, as they are farther removed from their
source; until at length contact with matter is possible, and
creation ensues. These are the emanations, æons, spirits, or
angels, of Gnosticism, conceived as more or less concrete and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>personal according to the different aspects in which they are
regarded in different systems.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. Practical errors of Gnosticism.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. Such is the bare outline (and nothing more is needed
for my immediate purpose) of the speculative views of Gnosticism.
But it is obvious that these views must have exerted
a powerful influence on the ethical systems of their advocates,
and thus they would involve important practical consequences.
If matter is the principle of evil, it is of infinite moment for a
man to know how he can avoid its baneful influence and thus
keep his higher nature unclogged and unsullied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Two opposite ethical rules.</div>

<p class='c000'>To this practical question two directly opposite answers
were given<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c016'><sup>[233]</sup></a>:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) Rigid asceticism.</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) On the one hand, it was contended that the desired
end might best be attained by a rigorous abstinence. Thus
communication with matter, if it could not be entirely avoided,
might be reduced to a minimum. Its grosser defilements
at all events would be escaped. The material part of man
would be subdued and mortified, if it could not be annihilated;
and the spirit, thus set free, would be sublimated, and rise to
its proper level. Thus the ethics of Gnosticism pointed in the
first instance to a strict <em>asceticism</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) Unrestrained license.</div>

<p class='c000'>(ii) But obviously the results thus attained are very slight
and inadequate. Matter is about us everywhere. We do but
touch the skirts of the evil, when we endeavour to fence ourselves
about by prohibitive ordinances, as for instance, when we
enjoin a spare diet or forbid marriage. Some more comprehensive
rule is wanted, which shall apply to every contingency
and every moment of our lives. Arguing in this way, other
Gnostic teachers arrived at an ethical rule directly opposed to
the former. ‘Cultivate an entire indifference,’ they said,
‘to the world of sense. Do not give it a thought one way or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the other, but follow your own impulses. The ascetic principle
assigns a certain importance to matter. The ascetic fails
in consequence to assert his own independence. The true rule
of life is to treat matter as something alien to you, towards
which you have no duties or obligations and which you can
use or leave unused as you like<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c016'><sup>[234]</sup></a>.’ In this way the reaction from
rigid asceticism led to the opposite extreme of unrestrained
<em>licentiousness</em>, both alike springing from the same false conception
of matter as the principle of evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Original independence of Gnosticism and its subsequent connexion with Christianity.</div>

<p class='c000'>Gnosticism, as defined by these characteristic features, has
obviously no necessary connexion with Christianity<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c016'><sup>[235]</sup></a>. Christianity
would naturally arouse it to unwonted activity, by leading
men to dwell more earnestly on the nature and power of
evil, and thus stimulating more systematic thought on the
theological questions which had already arrested attention.
After no long time Gnosticism would absorb into its system
more or fewer Christian elements, or Christianity in some of
its forms would receive a tinge from Gnosticism. But the
thing itself had an independent root, and seems to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>prior in time. The probabilities of the case, and the scanty
traditions of history, alike point to this independence of the
two<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c016'><sup>[236]</sup></a>. If so, it is a matter of little moment at what precise
time the name ‘Gnostic’ was adopted, whether before or after
contact with Christianity; for we are concerned only with the
growth and direction of thought which the name represents<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c016'><sup>[237]</sup></a>.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Its alliance with Judaism before Christianity.</div>

<p class='c000'>If then Gnosticism was not an offspring of Christianity,
but a direction of religious speculation which existed independently,
we are at liberty to entertain the question whether it
did not form an alliance with Judaism, contemporaneously
with or prior to its alliance with Christianity. There is at
least no obstacle which bars such an investigation at the outset.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>If this should prove to be the case, then we have a
combination which prepares the way for the otherwise strange
phenomena presented in the Epistle to the Colossians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The three sects of the Jews.</div>

<p class='c000'>Those, who have sought analogies to the three Jewish sects
among the philosophical schools of Greece and Rome, have compared
the Sadducees to the Epicureans, the Pharisees to the
Stoics, and the Essenes to the Pythagoreans. Like all historical
parallels, this comparison is open to misapprehension: but,
carefully guarded, the illustration is pertinent and instructive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sadduceeism, purely negative.</div>

<p class='c000'>With the Sadducees we have no concern here. Whatever
respect may be due to their attitude in the earlier stages of
their history, at the Christian era at least they have ceased to
deserve our sympathy; for their position has become mainly
<em>negative</em>. They take their stand on denials—the denial of the
existence of angels, the denial of the resurrection of the dead,
the denial of a progressive development in the Jewish Church.
In these negative tendencies, in the materialistic teaching of the
sect, and in the moral consequences to which it led, a very
rough resemblance to the Epicureans will appear<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c016'><sup>[238]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Phariseeism and Essenism compared.</div>

<p class='c000'>The two <em>positive</em> sects were the Pharisees and the Essenes.
Both alike were strict observers of the ritual law; but, while
the Pharisee was essentially <em>practical</em>, the tendency of the
Essene was to <em>mysticism</em>; while the Pharisee was a man of
the world, the Essene was a member of a brotherhood. In this
respect the Stoic and the Pythagorean were the nearest counterparts
which the history of Greek philosophy and social life could
offer. These analogies indeed are suggested by Josephus himself<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c016'><sup>[239]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Elusive features of Essenism.</div>

<p class='c000'>While the portrait of the Pharisee is distinctly traced and
easily recognised, this is not the case with the Essene. The
Essene is the great enigma of Hebrew history. Admired alike
by Jew, by Heathen, and by Christian, he yet remains a dim
vague outline, on which the highest subtlety of successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>critics has been employed to supply a substantial form and an
adequate colouring. An ascetic mystical dreamy recluse, he
seems too far removed from the hard experience of life to be
capable of realisation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A sufficiently distinct portrait of the sect attainable.</div>

<p class='c000'>And yet by careful use of the existing materials the
portrait of this sect may be so far restored, as to establish with
a reasonable amount of probability the point with which alone
we are here concerned. It will appear from the delineations
of ancient writers, more especially of Philo and Josephus, that
the characteristic feature of Essenism was a particular direction
of mystic speculation, involving a rigid asceticism as its practical
consequence. Following the definition of Gnosticism
which has been already given, we may not unfitly call this
tendency <em>Gnostic</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Main features of Essenism.</div>

<p class='c000'>Having anticipated the results in this statement, I shall
now endeavour to develope the main features of Essenism;
and, while doing so, I will ask my readers to bear in mind
the portrait of the Colossian heresy in St Paul, and to mark
the resemblances, as the enquiry proceeds<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c016'><sup>[240]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Judaic element is especially prominent in the life and
teaching of the sect. The Essene was exceptionally rigorous
in his observance of the Mosaic ritual. In his strict abstinence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Observance of the Mosaic law.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from work on the sabbath he far surpassed all the other Jews.
He would not light a fire, would not move a vessel, would not
perform even the most ordinary functions of life<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c016'><sup>[241]</sup></a>. The whole
day was given up to religious exercises and to exposition of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Scriptures<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c016'><sup>[242]</sup></a>. His respect for the law extended also to the law-giver.
After God, the name of Moses was held in the highest
reverence. He who blasphemed his name was punished with
death<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c016'><sup>[243]</sup></a>. In all these points the Essene was an exaggeration,
almost a caricature, of the Pharisee.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>External elements superadded.</div>
<p class='c000'>So far the Essene has not departed from the principles of
normal Judaism; but here the divergence begins. In three
main points we trace the working of influences, which must
have been derived from external sources.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. Rigid asceticism, in respect to</div>

<p class='c000'>1. To the legalism of the Pharisee, the Essene added an
asceticism, which was peculiarly his own, and which in many
respects contradicted the tenets of the other sect. The honourable,
and even exaggerated, estimate of marriage, which was
characteristic of the Jew, and of the Pharisee as the typical Jew,
found no favour with the Essene<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c016'><sup>[244]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>marriage,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Marriage was to him an
abomination. Those Essenes who lived together as members of
an order, and in whom the principles of the sect were carried to
their logical consequences, eschewed it altogether. To secure
the continuance of their brotherhood they adopted children,
whom they brought up in the doctrines and practices of the
community. There were others however who took a different
view. They accepted marriage, as necessary for the preservation
of the race. Yet even with them it seems to have been regarded
only as an inevitable evil. They fenced it off by stringent
rules, demanding a three years’ probation and enjoining various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>purificatory rites<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c016'><sup>[245]</sup></a>. The conception of marriage, as quickening
and educating the affections and thus exalting and refining
human life, was wholly foreign to their minds. Woman was
a mere instrument of temptation in their eyes, deceitful,
faithless, selfish, jealous, misled and misleading by her passions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>meats and drinks,</div>

<p class='c000'>But their ascetic tendencies did not stop here. The
Pharisee was very careful to observe the distinction of meats
lawful and unlawful, as laid down by the Mosaic code, and even
rendered these ordinances vexatious by minute definitions of
his own. But the Essene went far beyond him. He drank
no wine, he did not touch animal food. His meal consisted of
a piece of bread and a single mess of vegetables. Even this
simple fare was prepared for him by special officers consecrated
for the purpose, that it might be free from all contamination<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c016'><sup>[246]</sup></a>.
Nay, so stringent were the rules of the order on this point,
that when an Essene was excommunicated, he often died of
starvation, being bound by his oath not to take food prepared
by defiled hands, and thus being reduced to eat the very grass
of the field<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c016'><sup>[247]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and oil for anointing.</div>

<p class='c000'>Again, in hot climates oil for anointing the body is almost
a necessary of life. From this too the Essenes strictly abstained.
Even if they were accidentally smeared, they were
careful at once to wash themselves, holding the mere touch to
be a contamination<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c016'><sup>[248]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Underlying principle of this asceticism.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>From these facts it seems clear that Essene abstinence was
something more than the mere exaggeration of Pharisaic principles.
The rigour of the Pharisee was based on his obligation of
obedience to an absolute external law. The Essene introduced
a new principle. He condemned in any form the gratification
of the natural cravings, nor would he consent to regard it as
moral or immoral only according to the motive which suggested
it or the consequences which flowed from it. It was in
itself an absolute evil. He sought to disengage himself, as far
as possible, from the conditions of physical life. In short, in
the asceticism of the Essene we seem to see the germ of that
Gnostic dualism which regards matter as the principle, or at
least the abode, of evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Speculative tenets.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. And, when we come to investigate the speculative tenets
of the sect, we shall find that the Essenes have diverged
appreciably from the common type of Jewish orthodoxy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) Tendency to sun-worship.</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) Attention was directed above to their respect for
Moses and the Mosaic law, which they shared in common with
the Pharisee. But there was another side to their theological
teaching. Though our information is somewhat defective, still
in the scanty notices which are preserved we find sufficient
indications that they had absorbed some foreign elements of
religious thought into their system. Thus at day-break they
addressed certain prayers, which had been handed down from
their forefathers, to the Sun, ‘as if entreating him to rise<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c016'><sup>[249]</sup></a>.’
They were careful also to conceal and bury all polluting substances,
so as not ‘to insult the rays of the god<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c016'><sup>[250]</sup></a>.’ We cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>indeed suppose that they regarded the sun as more than a
symbol of the unseen power who gives light and life; but their
outward demonstrations of reverence were sufficiently prominent
to attach to them, or to a sect derived from them, the
epithet of ‘Sun-worshippers<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c016'><sup>[251]</sup></a>,’ and some connexion with the
characteristic feature of Parsee devotion at once suggests itself.
The practice at all events stands in strong contrast to the
denunciations of worship paid to the ‘hosts of heaven’ in the
Hebrew prophets.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) Resurrection of the body denied.</div>

<p class='c000'>(ii) Nor again is it an insignificant fact that, while the
Pharisee maintained the resurrection of the body as a cardinal
article of his faith, the Essene restricted himself to a belief in
the immortality of the soul. The soul, he maintained, was confined
in the flesh, as in a prison-house. Only when disengaged
from these fetters would it be truly free. Then it would
soar aloft, rejoicing in its newly attained liberty<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c016'><sup>[252]</sup></a>. This
doctrine accords with the fundamental conception of the
malignity of matter. To those who held this conception a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>resurrection of the body would be repulsive, as involving a
perpetuation of evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iii) Prohibition of sacrifices.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iii) But they also separated themselves from the religious
belief of the orthodox Jew in another respect, which would
provoke more notice. While they sent gifts to the temple
at Jerusalem, they refused to offer sacrifices there<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c016'><sup>[253]</sup></a>. It would
appear that the slaughter of animals was altogether forbidden
by their creed<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c016'><sup>[254]</sup></a>. It is certain that they were afraid of contracting
some ceremonial impurity by offering victims in the
temple. Meanwhile they had sacrifices, bloodless sacrifices, of
their own. They regarded their simple meals with their
accompanying prayers and thanksgiving, not only as devotional
but even as sacrificial rites. Those who prepared and presided
over these meals were their consecrated priests<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c016'><sup>[255]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iv) Esoteric doctrine of angels.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iv) In what other respects they may have departed from,
or added to, the normal creed of Judaism, we do not know.
But it is expressly stated that, when a novice after passing
through the probationary stages was admitted to the full privileges
of the order, the oath of admission bound him ‘to conceal
nothing from the members of the sect, and to report nothing
concerning them to others, even though threatened with death;
not to communicate any of their doctrines to anyone otherwise
than as he himself had received them; but to abstain from
robbery, and in like manner to guard carefully the books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of their sect, and <em>the names of the angels</em><a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c016'><sup>[256]</sup></a>.’ It may be reasonably
supposed that more lurks under this last expression than
meets the ear. This esoteric doctrine, relating to angelic beings,
may have been another link which attached Essenism to the
religion of Zoroaster<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c016'><sup>[257]</sup></a>. At all events we seem to be justified
in connecting it with the self-imposed service and worshipping
of angels at Colossæ: and we may well suspect that we have
here a germ which was developed into the Gnostic doctrine of
æons or emanations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(v) Speculations on God and Creation.</div>

<p class='c000'>(v) If so, it is not unconnected with another notice relating
to Essene peculiarities. The Gnostic doctrine of intermediate
beings between God and the world, as we have seen, was
intimately connected with speculations respecting creation.
Now we are specially informed that the Essenes, while leaving
physical studies in general to speculative idlers (μετεωρολέσχαις),
as being beyond the reach of human nature, yet
excepted from their general condemnation that philosophy
which treats of the existence of God and the generation of the
universe<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c016'><sup>[258]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(vi) Magical charms.</div>

<p class='c000'>(vi) Mention has been made incidentally of certain secret
books peculiar to the sect. The existence of such an apocryphal
literature was a sure token of some abnormal development in
doctrine<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c016'><sup>[259]</sup></a>. In the passage quoted it is mentioned in relation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>some form of angelology. Elsewhere their skill in prediction,
for which they were especially famous, is connected with the
perusal of certain ‘sacred books,’ which however are not
described<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c016'><sup>[260]</sup></a>. But more especially, we are told that the Essenes
studied with extraordinary diligence the writings of the
ancients, selecting those especially which could be turned to
profit for soul and body, and that from these they learnt the
qualities of roots and the properties of stones<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c016'><sup>[261]</sup></a>. This expression,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>as illustrated by other notices, points clearly to the study
of occult sciences, and recalls the alliance with the practice
of magical arts, which was a distinguishing feature of Gnosticism,
and is condemned by Christian teachers even in the
heresies of the Apostolic age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. Exclusive spirit of Essenism.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. But the notice to which I have just alluded suggests
a broader affinity with Gnosticism. Not only did the theological
speculations of the Essenes take a Gnostic turn, but
they guarded their peculiar tenets with Gnostic reserve. They
too had their esoteric doctrine which they looked upon as the
exclusive possession of the privileged few; their ‘mysteries’
which it was a grievous offence to communicate to the uninitiated.
This doctrine was contained, as we have seen, in an
apocryphal literature. Their whole organisation was arranged
so as to prevent the divulgence of its secrets to those without.
The long period of noviciate, the careful rites of initiation, the
distinction of the several orders<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c016'><sup>[262]</sup></a> in the community, the solemn
oaths by which they bound their members, were so many
safeguards against a betrayal of this precious deposit, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>they held to be restricted to the inmost circle of the brotherhood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The three notes of Gnosticism found in the Essenes.</div>

<p class='c000'>In selecting these details I have not attempted to give a
finished portrait of Essenism. From this point of view the delineation
would be imperfect and misleading: for I have left out
of sight the nobler features of the sect, their courageous endurance,
their simple piety, their brotherly love. My object was
solely to call attention to those features which distinguish
it from the normal type of Judaism, and seem to justify the
attribution of Gnostic influences. And here it has been seen
that the three characteristics, which were singled out above as
distinctive of Gnosticism, reappear in the Essenes; though it
has been convenient to consider them in the reversed order.
This Jewish sect exhibits the same exclusiveness in the communication
of its doctrines. Its theological speculations take
the same direction, dwelling on the mysteries of creation,
regarding matter as the abode of evil, and postulating certain
intermediate spiritual agencies as necessary links of communication
between heaven and earth. And lastly, its speculative
opinions involve the same ethical conclusions, and lead in
like manner to a rigid asceticism. If the notices relating to
these points do not always explain themselves, yet read in
the light of the heresies of the Apostolic age and in that of
subsequent Judæo-Gnostic Christianity, their bearing seems to
be distinct enough; so that we should not be far wrong, if we
were to designate Essenism as Gnostic Judaism<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c016'><sup>[263]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How widely were the Essenes dispersed?</div>

<p class='c000'>But the Essenes of whom historical notices are preserved
were inhabitants of the Holy Land. Their monasteries were
situated on the shores of the Dead Sea. We are told indeed,
that the sect was not confined to any one place, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>members of the order were found in great numbers in divers
cities and villages<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c016'><sup>[264]</sup></a>. But Judæa in one notice, Palestine and Syria
in another, are especially named as the localities of the Essene
settlements<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c016'><sup>[265]</sup></a>. Have we any reason to suppose that they were
represented among the Jews of the Dispersion? In Egypt
indeed we find ourselves confronted with a similar ascetic
sect, the Therapeutes, who may perhaps have had an independent
origin, but who nevertheless exhibit substantially the
same type of Jewish thought and practice<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c016'><sup>[266]</sup></a>. But the Dispersion
of Egypt, it may be argued, was exceptional; and we might
expect to find here organisations and developments of Judaism
hardly less marked and various than in the mother country.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Do they appear in Asia Minor?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What ground have we for assuming the existence of this type in
Asia Minor? Do we meet with any traces of it in the cities
of the Lycus, or in proconsular Asia generally, which would
justify the opinion that it might make its influence felt in
the Christian communities of that district?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How the term <em>Essene</em> is to be understood.</div>

<p class='c000'>Now it has been shown that the colonies of the Jews in
this neighbourhood were populous and influential<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c016'><sup>[267]</sup></a>; and it
might be argued with great probability that among these
large numbers Essene Judaism could not be unrepresented.
But indeed throughout this investigation, when I speak of
the Judaism in the Colossian Church as Essene, I do not
assume a precise identity of origin, but only an essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>affinity of type, with the Essenes of the mother country. As
a matter of history, it may or may not have sprung from the
colonies on the shores of the Dead Sea; but as this can neither
be proved nor disproved, so also it is immaterial to my main
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Probabilities of the case.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
purpose. All along its frontier, wherever Judaism became
enamoured of and was wedded to Oriental mysticism, the
same union would produce substantially the same results.
In a country where Phrygia, Persia, Syria, all in turn had
moulded religious thought, it would be strange indeed if
Judaism entirely escaped these influences. Nor, as a matter of
fact, are indications wanting to show that it was not unaffected
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Direct indications.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by them. If the traces are few, they are at least as numerous
and as clear as with our defective information on the whole
subject we have any right to expect in this particular instance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul at Ephesus <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 54–57.</div>

<p class='c000'>When St Paul visits Ephesus, he comes in contact with
certain strolling Jews, exorcists, who attempt to cast out evil
spirits<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c016'><sup>[268]</sup></a>. Connecting this fact with the notices of Josephus, from
which we infer that exorcisms of this kind were especially
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Exorcisms and<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
practised by the Essenes<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c016'><sup>[269]</sup></a>, we seem to have an indication of
their presence in the capital of proconsular Asia. If so, it is
a significant fact that in their exorcisms they employed the
name of our Lord: for then we must regard this as the earliest
notice of those overtures of alliance on the part of Essenism,
which involved such important consequences in the subsequent
history of the Church<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c016'><sup>[270]</sup></a>. It is also worth observing,
that the next incident in St Luke’s narrative is the burning
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>magical books.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of their magical books by those whom St Paul converted
on this occasion<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c016'><sup>[271]</sup></a>. As Jews are especially mentioned among
these converts, and as books of charms are ascribed to the
Essenes by Josephus, the two incidents, standing in this close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>connexion, throw great light on the type of Judaism which
thus appears at Ephesus<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c016'><sup>[272]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sibylline Oracle <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 80.</div>

<p class='c000'>Somewhat later we have another notice which bears in
the same direction. The Sibylline Oracle, which forms the
fourth book in the existing collection, is discovered by internal
evidence to have been written about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 80<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c016'><sup>[273]</sup></a>. It is plainly
a product of Judaism, but its Judaism does not belong to
the normal Pharisaic type. With Essenism it rejects sacrifices,
even regarding the shedding of blood as a pollution<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c016'><sup>[274]</sup></a>,
and with Essenism also it inculcates the duty of frequent
washings<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c016'><sup>[275]</sup></a>. Yet from other indications we are led to the conclusion,
that this poem was not written in the interests of
Essenism properly so called, but represents some allied though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>independent development of Judaism. In some respects at
all events its language seems quite inconsistent with the purer
type of Essenism<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c016'><sup>[276]</sup></a>. But its general tendency is clear: and
of its locality there can hardly be a doubt. The affairs of
Asia Minor occupy a disproportionate space in the poet’s description
of the past and vision of the future. The cities of
the Mæander and its neighbourhood, among these Laodicea,
are mentioned with emphasis<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c016'><sup>[277]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Phrygia and Asia congenial to this type of religion.</div>

<p class='c000'>And certainly the moral and intellectual atmosphere would
not be unfavourable to the growth of such a plant. The same
district, which in speculative philosophy had produced a Thales
and a Heraclitus<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c016'><sup>[278]</sup></a>, had developed in popular religion the worship
of the Phrygian Cybele and Sabazius and of the Ephesian
Artemis<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c016'><sup>[279]</sup></a>. Cosmological speculation, mystic theosophy,
religious fanaticism, all had their home here. Associated with
Judaism or with Christianity the natural temperament and the
intellectual bias of the people would take a new direction;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>but the old type would not be altogether obliterated. Phrygia
reared the hybrid monstrosities of Ophitism<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c016'><sup>[280]</sup></a>. She was the
mother of Montanist enthusiasm<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c016'><sup>[281]</sup></a>, and the foster-mother of
Novatian rigorism<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c016'><sup>[282]</sup></a>. The syncretist, the mystic, the devotee,
the puritan, would find a congenial climate in these regions
of Asia Minor.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Previous results summed up.</div>

<p class='c000'>It has thus been shown <em>first</em>, that Essene Judaism was
Gnostic in its character; and <em>secondly</em>, that this type of Jewish
thought and practice had established itself in the Apostolic age
in those parts of Asia Minor with which we are more directly
concerned. It now remains to examine the heresy of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Is the Colossian heresy Gnostic?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Colossian Church more nearly, and to see whether it deserves
the name, which provisionally was given to it, of Gnostic
Judaism. Its Judaism all will allow. Its claim to be regarded
as Gnostic will require a closer scrutiny. And in conducting
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Three notes of Gnosticism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
this examination, it will be convenient to take the three notes
of Gnosticism which have been already laid down, and to enquire
how far it satisfies these tests.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. Intellectual exclusiveness.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. It has been pointed out that Gnosticism strove to establish,
or rather to preserve, an <em>intellectual oligarchy</em> in religion.
It had its hidden wisdom, its exclusive mysteries, its privileged
class.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now I think it will be evident, that St Paul in this epistle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>St Paul contends for the universality of the Gospel,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
feels himself challenged to contend for the <em>universality</em> of the
Gospel. This indeed is a characteristic feature of the Apostle’s
teaching at all times, and holds an equally prominent place in
the epistles of an earlier date. But the point to be observed is,
that the Apostle, in maintaining this doctrine, has changed the
mode of his defence; and this fact suggests that there has been
a change in the direction of the attack. It is no longer against
national exclusiveness, but against intellectual exclusiveness,
that he contends. His adversaries do not now plead ceremonial
restrictions, or at least do not plead these alone: but they erect
an artificial barrier of spiritual privilege, even more fatal to
the universal claims of the Gospel, because more specious and
more insidious. It is not now against Jew as such, but against
the Jew become Gnostic, that he fights the battle of liberty.
In other words; it is not against Christian Pharisaism but
against Christian Essenism that he defends his position.
Only in the light of such an antagonism can we understand the
emphatic iteration with which he claims to ‘warn <em>every</em> man
and teach <em>every</em> man in <em>every</em> wisdom, that he may present
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>against the pretentions of an aristocracy of intellect.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<em>every</em> man perfect in Christ Jesus<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c016'><sup>[283]</sup></a>.’ It will be remembered
that ‘wisdom’ in Gnostic teaching was the exclusive possession of
the few; it will not be forgotten that ‘perfection’ was the term
especially applied in their language to this privileged minority,
as contradistinguished from the common herd of believers;
and thus it will be readily understood why St Paul should go
on to say that this universality of the Gospel is the one object
of his contention, to which all the energies of his life are
directed, and having done so, should express his intense anxiety
for the Churches of Colossæ and the neighbourhood, lest they
should be led astray by a spurious wisdom to desert the true
knowledge<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c016'><sup>[284]</sup></a>. This danger also will enable us to appreciate a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>novel feature in another passage of the epistle. While dwelling
on the obliteration of all distinctions in Christ, he repeats his
earlier contrasts, ‘Greek and Jew,’ ‘circumcision and uncircumcision,’
‘bondslave and free’; but to these he adds new words
which at once give a wider scope and a more immediate application
to the lesson. In Christ the existence of ‘barbarian’ and
even ‘Scythian,’ the lowest type of barbarian, is extinguished<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c016'><sup>[285]</sup></a>.
As culture, civilisation, philosophy, knowledge, are no conditions
of acceptance, so neither is their absence any disqualification in
the believer. The aristocracy of intellectual discernment, which
Gnosticism upheld in religion, is abhorrent to the first principles
of the Gospel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>He contrasts the true wisdom with the false,</div>

<p class='c000'>Hence also must be explained the frequent occurrence of
the words ‘wisdom’ (σοφία), ‘intelligence’ (σύνεσις), ‘knowledge’
(γνῶσις), ‘perfect knowledge’ (ἐπίγνωσις), in this epistle<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c016'><sup>[286]</sup></a>. St
Paul takes up the language of his opponents, and translates it
into a higher sphere. The false teachers put forward a ‘philosophy,’
but it was only an empty deceit, only a plausible display
of false-reasoning<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c016'><sup>[287]</sup></a>. They pretended ‘wisdom,’ but it was
merely the profession, not the reality<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c016'><sup>[288]</sup></a>. Against these pretentions
the Apostle sets the true wisdom of the Gospel. On its wealth,
its fulness, its perfection, he is never tired of dwelling<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c016'><sup>[289]</sup></a>. The
true wisdom, he would argue, is essentially spiritual and yet
essentially definite; while the false is argumentative, is speculative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and dwells on the veritable mystery.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is vague and dreamy<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c016'><sup>[290]</sup></a>. Again they had their rites of
initiation. St Paul contrasts with these the one universal, comprehensive
mystery<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c016'><sup>[291]</sup></a>, the knowledge of God in Christ. This
mystery is complete in itself: it contains ‘all the treasures of
wisdom and of knowledge hidden’ in it<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c016'><sup>[292]</sup></a>. Moreover it is offered
to all without distinction: though once hidden, its revelation is
unrestricted, except by the waywardness and disobedience of
men. The esoteric spirit of Gnosticism finds no countenance in
the Apostle’s teaching.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Speculative tenets.<br />Cosmogony and theology.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. From the informing spirit of Gnosticism we turn to the
speculative tenets—the cosmogony and the theology of the
Gnostic.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here too the affinities to Gnosticism reveal themselves
in the Colossian heresy. We cannot fail to observe that the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>St Paul attacks the doctrine of angelic mediators,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Apostle has in view the doctrine of intermediate agencies, regarded
as instruments in the creation and government of the
world. Though this tenet is not distinctly mentioned, it is
tacitly assumed in the teaching which St Paul opposes to it.
Against the philosophy of successive evolutions from the Divine
nature, angelic mediators forming the successive links in the
chain which binds the finite to the Infinite, he sets the doctrine
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>setting against it the doctrine of the Word Incarnate,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the one Eternal Son, the Word of God begotten before the
worlds<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c016'><sup>[293]</sup></a>. The angelology of the heretics had a twofold bearing;
it was intimately connected at once with cosmogony and with
religion. Correspondingly St Paul represents the mediatorial
function of Christ as twofold: it is exercised in the natural
creation, and it is exercised in the spiritual creation. In both
these spheres His initiative is absolute, His control is universal,
His action is complete. By His agency the world of matter was
created and is sustained. He is at once the beginning and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>as the reconciler of heaven and earth.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
end of the material universe; ‘All things have been created
through Him and unto Him.’ Nor is His office in the spiritual
world less complete. In the Church, as in the Universe, He is
sole, absolute, supreme; the primary source from which all life
proceeds and the ultimate arbiter in whom all feuds are reconciled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His relations to (1) Deity; as God manifested.</div>

<p class='c000'>On the one hand, in relation to Deity, He is the visible
image of the invisible God. He is not only the chief manifestation
of the Divine nature: He exhausts the Godhead manifested.
In Him resides the totality of the Divine powers and
attributes. For this totality Gnostic teachers had a technical
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <em>pleroma</em> resides in Him.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
term, the <em>pleroma</em> or <em>plenitude</em><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c016'><sup>[294]</sup></a>. From the pleroma they supposed
that all those agencies issued, through which God has at
any time exerted His power in creation, or manifested His will
through revelation. These mediatorial beings would retain more
or less of its influence, according as they claimed direct parentage
from it or traced their descent through successive evolutions.
But in all cases this pleroma was distributed, diluted, transformed
and darkened by foreign admixture. They were only partial and
blurred images, often deceptive caricatures, of their original,
broken lights of the great central Light. It is not improbable
that, like later speculators of the same school, they found a place
somewhere or other in their genealogy of spiritual beings for
the Christ. If so, St Paul’s language becomes doubly significant.
But this hypothesis is not needed to explain its reference.
In contrast to their doctrine, he asserts and repeats the assertion,
that the pleroma abides absolutely and wholly in Christ
as the Word of God<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c016'><sup>[295]</sup></a>. The entire light is concentrated in
Him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(2) Created things; as absolute Lord.</div>

<p class='c000'>Hence it follows that, as regards created things, His supremacy
must be absolute. In heaven as in earth, over things
immaterial as over things material, He is king. Speculations on
the nature of intermediate spiritual agencies—their names, their
ranks, their offices—were rife in the schools of Judæo-Gnostic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>thought. ‘Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers’–these
formed part of the spiritual nomenclature which they had
invented to describe different grades of angelic mediators.
Without entering into these speculations, the Apostle asserts
that Christ is Lord of all, the highest and the lowest, whatever
rank they may hold and by whatever name they are
called<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c016'><sup>[296]</sup></a>, for they are parts of creation and He is the source of
creation. Through Him they became, and unto Him they
tend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Angelolatry is therefore condemned</div>

<p class='c000'>Hence the worship of angels, which the false teachers inculcated,
was utterly wrong in principle. The motive of this
angelolatry it is not difficult to imagine. There was a show of
humility<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c016'><sup>[297]</sup></a>, for there was a confession of weakness, in this subservience
to inferior mediatorial agencies. It was held feasible
to grasp at the lower links of the chain which bound earth
to heaven, when heaven itself seemed far beyond the reach
of man. The successive grades of intermediate beings were
as successive steps, by which man might mount the ladder
leading up to the throne of God. This carefully woven web
of sophistry the Apostle tears to shreds. The doctrine of the
false teachers was based on confident assumptions respecting
angelic beings of whom they could know nothing. It was
moreover a denial of Christ’s twofold personality and His
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>as a denial of His perfect mediation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
mediatorial office. It follows from the true conception of
Christ’s Person, that He and He alone can bridge over the
chasm between earth and heaven; for He is at once the lowest
and the highest. He raises up man to God, for He brings down
God to man. Thus the chain is reduced to a single link,
this link being the Word made flesh. As the <em>pleroma</em> resides
in Him, so is it communicated to us through Him<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c016'><sup>[298]</sup></a>. To substitute
allegiance to any other spiritual mediator is to sever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the connexion of the limbs with the Head, which is the centre
of life and the mainspring of all energy throughout the body<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c016'><sup>[300]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Apostle’s practical inference.</div>

<p class='c000'>Hence follows the practical conclusion, that, whatever is
done, must be done in the name of the Lord<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c016'><sup>[301]</sup></a>. Wives must
submit to their husbands ‘in the Lord’: children must obey
their parents ‘in the Lord’: servants must work for the masters
as working ‘unto the Lord<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c016'><sup>[302]</sup></a>.’ This iteration, ‘in the Lord,’
‘unto the Lord,’ is not an irrelevant form of words; but arises
as an immediate inference from the main idea which underlies
the doctrinal portion of the epistle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. Moral results of Gnostic doctrine.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. It has been shown that the speculative tenets of Gnosticism
might lead (and as a matter of fact we know that
they did lead) to either of two practical extremes, to rigid
asceticism or to unbridled license. The latter alternative appears
to some extent in the heresy of the Pastoral Epistles<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c016'><sup>[303]</sup></a>,
and still more plainly in those of the Catholic Epistles<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c016'><sup>[304]</sup></a> and
the Apocalypse<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c016'><sup>[305]</sup></a>. It is constantly urged by Catholic writers as
a reproach against later Gnostic sects<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c016'><sup>[306]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Asceticism of the Colossian heresy</div>

<p class='c000'>But the former and nobler extreme was the first impulse
of the Gnostic.  To escape from the infection of evil by escaping
from the domination of matter was his chief anxiety. This
appears very plainly in the Colossian heresy. Though the prohibitions
to which the Apostle alludes might be explained in
part by the ordinances of the Mosaic ritual, this explanation
will not cover all the facts. Thus for instance drinks are
mentioned as well as meats<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c016'><sup>[307]</sup></a>, though on the former the law
of Moses is silent. Thus again the rigorous denunciation, ‘Touch
not, taste not, handle not<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c016'><sup>[308]</sup></a>,’ seems to go very far beyond the
Levitical enactments. And moreover the <em>motive</em> of these prohibitions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>not explained by its Judaism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is Essene rather than Pharisaic, Gnostic rather than
Jewish. These severities of discipline were intended ‘to check
indulgence of the flesh<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c016'><sup>[309]</sup></a>.’ They professed to treat the body
with entire disregard, to ignore its cravings and to deny its
wants. In short; they betray a strong <em>ascetic</em> tendency<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c016'><sup>[310]</sup></a>, of
which normal Judaism, as represented by the Pharisee, offers
no explanation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul’s reply shows its Gnostic bearing.</div>

<p class='c000'>And St Paul’s answer points to the same inference. The
difference will appear more plainly, if we compare it with his
treatment of Pharisaic Judaism in the Galatian Church. This
epistle offers nothing at all corresponding to his language on
that occasion; ‘If righteousness be by law, then Christ died
in vain’; ‘If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing’;
‘Christ is nullified for you, whosoever are justified by
law; ye are fallen from grace<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c016'><sup>[311]</sup></a>.’ The point of view in fact is
wholly changed. With these Essene or Gnostic Judaizers the
Mosaic law was neither the motive nor the standard, it was only
the starting point, of their austerities. Hence in replying the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>It is no longer the contrast of law and grace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Apostle no longer deals with law, as law; he no longer points
the contrast of grace and works; but he enters upon the <em>moral</em>
aspects of these ascetic practices. He denounces them, as concentrating
the thoughts on earthly and perishable things<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c016'><sup>[312]</sup></a>.
He points out that they fail in their purpose, and are found
valueless against carnal indulgences<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c016'><sup>[313]</sup></a>. In their place he offers
the true and only remedy against sin—the elevation of the
inner life in Christ, the transference of the affections into a
higher sphere<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c016'><sup>[314]</sup></a>, where the temptations of the flesh are powerless.
Thus dying with Christ, they will kill all their earthly members<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c016'><sup>[315]</sup></a>.
Thus rising with Christ, they will be renewed in the
image of God their Creator<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c016'><sup>[316]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The truth of the above result tested by</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>In attempting to draw a complete portrait of the Colossian
heresy from a few features accidentally exhibited in St Paul’s
epistle, it has  been necessary  to supply certain links; and
some  assurance  may not unreasonably be required that this
has not been done arbitrarily. Nor is this security wanting.
In all such cases the test will be twofold. The result must
be consistent with itself: and it must do no violence to the
historical conditions under which the phenomena arose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(1) Its inherent consistency and symmetry.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. In the present instance the former of these tests is fully
satisfied. The consistency and the symmetry of the result is
its great recommendation. The  postulate of a Gnostic type
brings the separate parts of the representation into direct connexion.
The speculative opinions and the practical tendencies
of the heresy thus explain, and are explained by, each
other. It is analogous to the hypothesis of the comparative
anatomist, who by referring the fossil remains to their proper
type restores the whole skeleton of some unknown animal from
a few bones belonging to different extremities of the body, and
without the intermediate and connecting parts. In the one case,
as in the other, the result is the justification of the postulate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(2) Its place in a historical sequence.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. And again; the historical conditions of the problem
are carefully observed. It has been shown already, that Judaism
in the preceding age had in one of its developments
assumed a form which was the natural precursor of the Colossian
heresy. In order to complete the argument it will be
necessary to show that Christianity in the generation next succeeding
exhibited a perverted type, which was its natural outgrowth.
If this can be done, the Colossian heresy will take
its proper place in a regular historical sequence.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Continuance of this type of Judæo-Gnosticism in the district.</div>

<p class='c000'>I have already pointed out, that the language of St John
in the Apocalypse, which was probably written within a few
years of this epistle, seems to imply the continuance in this
district of the same type of heresy which is here denounced
by St Paul<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c016'><sup>[317]</sup></a>. But the notices in this book are not more definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>than those of the Epistle to the Colossians itself; and
we are led to look outside the Canonical writings for some
more explicit evidence. Has early Christian history then preserved
any record of a distinctly Gnostic school existing on the
confines of the Apostolic age, which may be considered a legitimate
development of the phase of religious speculation that
confronts us here?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Heresy of Cerinthus.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>His date and place.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c000'>We find exactly the phenomenon which we are seeking in
the heresy of Cerinthus<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c016'><sup>[318]</sup></a>. The time, the place, the circumstances,
all agree. This heresiarch is said to have been originally
a native of Alexandria<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c016'><sup>[319]</sup></a>; but proconsular Asia is allowed
on all hands to have been the scene of his activity as a
teacher<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c016'><sup>[320]</sup></a>. He lived and taught at the close of the Apostolic
age, that is, in the latest decade of the first century. Some
writers indeed make him an antagonist of St Peter and St
Paul<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c016'><sup>[321]</sup></a>, but their authority is not trustworthy, nor is this very
early date at all probable. But there can be no reasonable
doubt that he was a contemporary of St John, who was related
by Polycarp to have denounced him face to face on one memorable
occasion<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c016'><sup>[322]</sup></a>, and is moreover said by Irenæus to have
written his Gospel with the direct object of confuting his errors<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c016'><sup>[323]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cerinthus a link between Judaism and Gnosticism.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>‘Cerinthus,’ writes Neander, ‘is best entitled to be considered
as the intermediate link between the Judaizing and
the Gnostic sects.’ ‘Even among the ancients,’ he adds, ‘opposite
reports respecting his doctrines have been given from opposite
points of view, according as the Gnostic or the Judaizing element
was exclusively insisted upon: and the dispute on this point
has been kept up even to modern times. In point of chronology
too Cerinthus may be regarded as representing the principle
in its transition from Judaism to Gnosticism<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c016'><sup>[324]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Judaism still prominent in his system</div>

<p class='c000'>Of his Judaism no doubt has been or can be entertained.
The gross Chiliastic doctrine ascribed to him<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c016'><sup>[325]</sup></a>, even though
it may have been exaggerated in the representations of adverse
writers, can only be explained by a Jewish origin. His
conception of the Person of Christ was Ebionite, that is Judaic,
in its main features<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c016'><sup>[326]</sup></a>. He is said moreover to have enforced
the rite of circumcision and to have inculcated the observance
of sabbaths<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c016'><sup>[327]</sup></a>. It is related also that the Cerinthians, like the
Ebionites, accepted the Gospel of St Matthew alone<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c016'><sup>[328]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>though Gnosticism is already aggressive.</div>

<p class='c000'>At the same time, it is said by an ancient writer that his
adherence to Judaism was only partial<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c016'><sup>[329]</sup></a>. This limitation is
doubtless correct. As Gnostic principles asserted themselves
more distinctly, pure Judaism necessarily suffered. All or nearly
all the early Gnostic heresies were Judaic; and for a time a
compromise was effected which involved more or less concession
on either side. But the ultimate incompatibility of the two
at length became evident, and a precarious alliance was exchanged
for an open antagonism. This final result however
was not reached till the middle of the second century: and
meanwhile it was a question to what extent Judaism was prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to make concessions for the sake of this new ally. Even
the Jewish Essenes, as we have seen, departed from the orthodox
position in the matter of sacrifices; and if we possessed
fuller information, we should probably find that they made
still larger concessions than this. Of the Colossian heretics
we can only form a conjecture, but the angelology and angelolatry
attributed to them point to a further step in the
same direction. As we pass from them to Cerinthus we are
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Gnostic element in his teaching.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
no longer left in doubt; for the Gnostic element has clearly
gained the ascendant, though it has not yet driven its rival
out of the field. Two characteristic features in his teaching
especially deserve consideration, both as evincing the tendency
of his speculations and as throwing back light on the notices
in the Colossian Epistle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. His Gnostic Cosmogony</div>

<p class='c000'>1. His cosmogony is essentially Gnostic. The great problem
of creation presented itself to him in the same aspect;
and the solution which he offered was generically the same.
The world, he asserted, was not made by the highest God,
but by an angel or power far removed from, and ignorant of,
this supreme Being<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c016'><sup>[330]</sup></a>. Other authorities describing his system
speak not of a single power, but of powers, as creating
the universe<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c016'><sup>[331]</sup></a>; but all alike represent this demiurge, or these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>demiurges, as ignorant of the absolute God. It is moreover
stated that he held the Mosaic law to have been given not
by the supreme God Himself, but by this angel, or one of
these angels, who created the world<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c016'><sup>[332]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and consequent angelology.</div>

<p class='c000'>From these notices it is plain that angelology had an important
place in his speculations; and that he employed it
to explain the existence of evil supposed to be inherent in
the physical world, as well as to account for the imperfections
of the old dispensation. The ‘remote distance’ of his angelic
demiurge from the supreme God can hardly be explained except
on the hypothesis of <em>successive</em> generations of these intermediate
agencies. Thus his solution is thoroughly Gnostic.
At the same time, as contrasted with later and more sharply
defined Gnostic systems, the Judaic origin and complexion of
his cosmogony is obvious. His intermediate agencies still retain
the name and the personality of angels, and have not
yet given way to those vague idealities which, as emanations
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Angels of earlier and æons of later Gnostics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or æons, took their place in later speculations. Thus his theory
is linked on to the angelology of later Judaism founded on
the angelic appearances recorded in the Old Testament narrative.
And again: while later Gnostics represent the demiurge
and giver of the law as antagonistic to the supreme and
good God, Cerinthus does not go beyond postulating his ignorance.
He went as far as he could without breaking entirely
with the Old Testament and abandoning his Judaic standing-ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cerinthus a link between the Colossian heresy and later Gnosticism.</div>

<p class='c000'>In these respects Cerinthus is the proper link between the
incipient gnosis of the Colossian heretics and the mature
gnosis of the second century. In the Colossian epistle we
still breathe the atmosphere of Jewish angelology, nor is there
any trace of the <em>æon</em> of later Gnosticism<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c016'><sup>[333]</sup></a>; while yet speculation
is so far advanced that the angels have an important function
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>in explaining the mysteries of the creation and government
of the world. On the other hand it has not reached the
point at which we find it in Cerinthus. Gnostic conceptions
respecting the relation of the demiurgic agency to the supreme
God would appear to have passed through three stages. This
relation was represented first, as imperfect appreciation; next,
as entire ignorance; lastly, as direct antagonism. The second
and third are the standing points of Cerinthus and of the later
Gnostic teachers respectively. The first was probably the
position of the Colossian false teachers. The imperfections
of the natural world, they would urge, were due to the limited
capacities of these angels to whom the demiurgic work was
committed, and to their imperfect sympathy with the supreme
God; but at the same time they might fitly receive worship
as mediators between God and man; and indeed humanity
seemed in its weakness to need the intervention of some such
beings less remote from itself than the highest heaven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. His Christology.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. Again the Christology of Cerinthus deserves attention
from this point of view. Here all our authorities are agreed.
As a Judaizer Cerinthus held with the Ebionites that Jesus
was only the son of Joseph and Mary, born in the natural way.
As a Gnostic he maintained that the Christ first descended in
the form of a dove on the carpenter’s son at his baptism; that
He revealed to him the unknown Father, and worked miracles
through him: and that at length He took His flight and left
him, so that Jesus alone suffered and rose, while the Christ
remained impassible<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c016'><sup>[334]</sup></a>. It would appear also, though this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>not certain, that he described this re-ascension of the Christ, as
a return ‘to His own <em>pleroma</em><a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c016'><sup>[335]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Approach towards Cerinthian Christology in the Colossian heresy.</div>

<p class='c000'>Now it is not clear from St Paul’s language what opinions
the Colossian heretics held respecting the person of our Lord;
but we may safely assume that he regarded them as inadequate
and derogatory. The emphasis, with which he asserts the
eternal being and absolute sovereignty of Christ, can hardly be
explained in any other way. But individual expressions tempt
us to conjecture that the same ideas were already floating in
the air, which ultimately took form and consistency in the
tenets of Cerinthus. Thus, when he reiterates the statement
that the <em>whole</em> pleroma abides <em>permanently</em> in Christ<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c016'><sup>[336]</sup></a>, he
would appear to be tacitly refuting some opinion which maintained
only mutable and imperfect relations between the two.
When again he speaks of the true gospel first taught to the
Colossians as the doctrine of ‘the Christ, <em>even</em> Jesus the Lord<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c016'><sup>[337]</sup></a>,’
his language might seem to be directed against the tendency
to separate the heavenly Christ from the earthly Jesus, as
though the connexion were only transient. When lastly he
dwells on the work of reconciliation, as wrought ‘through the
blood of Christ’s cross,’ ‘in the body of His flesh through
death<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c016'><sup>[338]</sup></a>,’ we may perhaps infer that he already discerned a
disposition to put aside Christ’s passion as a stumbling-block
in the way of philosophical religion. Thus regarded, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Apostle’s language gains force and point; though no stress can
be laid on explanations which are so largely conjectural.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Gnosticism of the Colossians being vague and undeveloped.</div>

<p class='c000'>But if so, the very generality of his language shows that
these speculations were still vague and fluctuating. The difference
which separates these heretics from Cerinthus may be
measured by the greater precision and directness in the Apostolic
counter-statement, as we turn from the Epistle to the
Colossians to the Gospel of St John. In this interval, extending
over nearly a quarter of a century, speculation had taken
a definite shape. The elements of Gnostic theory, which
were before held in solution, had meanwhile crystallized around
the facts of the Gospel. Yet still we seem justified, even at
the earlier date, in speaking of these general ideas as Gnostic,
guarding ourselves at the same time against misunderstanding
with the twofold caution, that we here employ the term to
express the simplest and most elementary conceptions of this
tendency of thought, and that we do not postulate its use as a
distinct designation of any sect or sects at this early date.
Thus limited, the view that the writer of this epistle is combating
a Gnostic heresy seems free from all objections, while it
appears necessary to explain his language; and certainly it
does not, as is sometimes imagined, place any weapon in the
hands of those who would assail the early date and Apostolic
authorship of the epistle.</p>

<div class='sidenote c015'>Various forms of the name in Greek.</div>

<p class='c000'>The name is variously written in Greek;</p>

in Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> iv. 22; Porphyr. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Abstin.</cite></span> iv. 11. So
too Joseph. <cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 7. 3, ii. 20. 4, iii. 2. 1; <cite>Ant.</cite> xv. 10. 4;
though in the immediate context of this last passage he
writes Ἐσσηνός, if the common texts may be trusted.</p>

<p class='c020'>3. Ὀσσαῖος: Epiphan. <cite>Hær.</cite> pp. 40 sq., 125, 462. The common
texts very frequently make him write Ὀσσηνός, but see
Dindorf’s notes, Epiphan. <cite>Op.</cite> 1. pp. 380, 425. With Epiphanius
the Essenes are a Samaritan, the Ossæans a Judaic
sect. He has evidently got his information from two distinct
sources, and does not see that the same persons are intended.</p>

<p class='c020'>4. Ιἐσσαῖος, Epiphan. <cite>Hær.</cite> p. 117. From the connexion the
same sect again seems to be meant: but owing to the form
Epiphanius conjectures (οἶμαι) that the name is derived from
Jesse, the father of David.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>All etymologies to be rejected which derive the name.</div>

<p class='c000'>If any certain example could be produced where the name occurs
in any early Hebrew or Aramaic writing, the question of its derivation
would probably be settled; but in the absence of a single decisive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>instance a wide field is opened for conjecture, and critics have not
been backward in availing themselves of the license. In discussing
the claims of the different etymologies proposed we may reject:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) From the Greek;</div>

<p class='c000'><em>First</em>: derivations from the Greek. Thus Philo connects the word
with ὅσιος ‘holy’: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quod omn. prob.</cite></span> 12, p. 457 Ἐσσαῖοι ... διαλέκτου
ἑλληνικῆς παρώνυμοι ὁσιότητος, § 13, p. 459 τῶν Ἐσσαίων ἢ ὁσίων,
<cite>Fragm.</cite> p. 632 καλοῦνται μὲν Ἐσσαῖοι, παρὰ τὴν ὁσιότητα, μοὶ δοκῶ
[δοκεῖ;], τῆς προσηγορίας ἀξιωθέντες. It is not quite clear whether
Philo is here playing with words after the manner of his master
Plato, or whether he holds a pre-established harmony to exist among
different languages by which similar sounds represent similar things,
or whether lastly he seriously means that the name was directly
derived from the Greek word ὅσιος. The last supposition is the least
probable; but he certainly does not reject this derivation ‘as incorrect’
(Ginsburg <cite>Essenes</cite> p. 27), nor can παρώνυμοι ὁσιότητος be rendered
‘from an incorrect derivation from the Greek homonym <em>hosiotes</em>’
(ib. p. 32), since the word παρώνυμος never involves the notion of <em>false</em>
etymology. The amount of truth which probably underlies Philo’s
statement will be considered hereafter. Another Greek derivation
is ἴσος, ‘companion, associate,’ suggested by Rapoport, <cite>Erech Millin</cite>
p. 41. Several others again are suggested by Löwy, s.v. Essäer, e.g.
ἔσω from their esoteric doctrine, or αἶσα from their fatalism. All
such may be rejected as instances of ingenious trifling, if indeed
they deserve to be called ingenious.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) From names of persons or places;</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Secondly</em>: derivations from proper names whether of persons or
of places.  Thus the word has been derived from <em>Jesse</em> the father of
David (Epiphan. l.c.), or from one ישי Isai, the disciple of R.
Joshua ben Perachia who migrated to Egypt in the time of Alexander
Jannæus (Löw in <cite>Ben Chananja</cite> i. p. 352).  Again it has been
referred to the town <em>Essa</em> (a doubtful reading in Joseph. <cite>Ant.</cite> xiii.
15. 3) beyond the Jordan. And other similar derivations have been
suggested.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>From Hebrew roots not supplying the right consonants,</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Thirdly</em>: etymologies from the Hebrew or Aramaic, which do
not supply the right consonants, or do not supply them in the right
order. Under this head several must be rejected;</p>

<p class='c020'>אסר <em>āsar</em> ‘to bind,’ Adler <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Volkslehrer</cite></span> VI. p. 50, referred to by
Ginsburg <cite>Essenes</cite> p. 29.</p>

<p class='c020'>חסיד <em>chāsīd</em> ‘pious,’ which is represented by Ἀσιδαῖος (1 Macc.
ii. 42 (v. l.), vii. 13, 2 Macc. xiv. 6), and could not possibly assume
the form Ἐσσαῖος or Ἐσσηνός. Yet this derivation appears in Josippon
ben Gorion (iv. 6, 7, v. 24, pp. 274, 278, 451), who substitutes
<em>Chasidim</em> in narratives where the Essenes are mentioned in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>original of Josephus; and it has been adopted by many more recent
writers.</p>

<p class='c020'>סחא <em>s’āch</em> ‘to bathe,’ from which with an <em>Aleph</em> prefixed we
might get אסהאי <em>as’chai</em> ‘bathers’ (a word however which does not
occur): Grätz <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch. der Juden</cite></span> iii. pp. 82, 468.</p>

<p class='c020'>צנוע <em>tsanūaع</em> ‘retired, modest,’ adopted by Frankel (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschrift</cite></span>
1846, p. 449, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Monatschrift</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II[.</span> p. 32) after a suggestion by Löw.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>such as those which make <em>n</em> part of the root.</div>

<p class='c000'>To this category must be assigned those etymologies which contain
a ו as the third consonant of the root; since the comparison of
the parallel forms Ἐσσαῖος and Ἐσσηνός shows that in the latter
word the ν is only formative. On this ground we must reject:</p>

<p class='c000'>חסין <em>chāsīn</em>; see below under עשין.</p>

<p class='c000'>חצן <em>chōtsen</em> ‘a fold’ of a garment, and so supposed to signify the
περίζωμα or ‘apron’, which was given to every neophyte among the
Essenes (Joseph. <cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 5, 7): suggested by Jellinek <cite>Ben Chananja</cite>
<span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 374.</p>

<p class='c000'>עשין <em>عāshīn</em> ‘strong’: see Cohn in Frankel’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Monatschrift</cite></span> VII.
p. 271. This etymology is suggested to explain Epiphanius <cite>Hær.</cite>
p. 40 τοῦτο δὲ τὸ γένος τῶν Ὀσσηνῶν ἑρμηνεύεται διὰ τῆς ἐκδόσεως
τοῦ ὀνόματος στιβαρὸν γένος (‘a sturdy race’). The name ‘Essene’
is so interpreted also in Makrisi (de Sacy, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chrestom. Arab.</cite></span> I. p. 114,
306); but, as he himself writes it with <em>Elif</em> and not <em>Ain</em>, it is plain
that he got this interpretation from some one else, probably from
Epiphanius. The correct reading however in Epiphanius is Ὀσσαίων,
not Ὀσσηνῶν; and it would therefore appear that this father or his
informant derived the word from the Hebrew root עןו rather than
from the Aramaic עשן. The Ὀσσαῖοι would then be the עויס, and this
is so far a possible derivation, that the <em>n</em> does not enter into the root.
Another word suggested to explain the etymology of Epiphanius is the
Aramaic חסין <em>chāsīn</em> ‘powerful, strong’ (from הסן); but this is open
to the same objections as עשין.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other derivations considered:</div>

<p class='c000'>When all such derivations are eliminated as untenable or improbable,
considerable uncertainty still remains. The 1st and 3rd radicals
might be any of the gutturals א,ה,ח,ע; and the Greek ς, as the
2nd radical, might represent any one of several Shemitic sibilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus we have the choice of the following etymologies, which have
found more or less favour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(1) אסיא ‘a physician’;</div>

<p class='c000'>(1) אסא <em>ăsā</em> ‘to heal,’ whence אסיא <em>asyā</em>, ‘a physician.’
The Essenes are supposed to be so called because Josephus states
(<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 6) that they paid great attention to the qualities of herbs
and minerals with a view to the healing of diseases (πρὸς θεραπείαν
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>παθῶν). This etymology is supported likewise by an appeal to the
name θεραπευταί, which Philo gives to an allied sect in Egypt (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Vit.
Cont.</cite></span> § 1, II. p. 471). It seems highly improbable however, that the
ordinary name of the Essenes should have been derived from a
pursuit which was merely secondary and incidental; while the supposed
analogy of the Therapeutæ rests on a wrong interpretation of
the word. Philo indeed (l.c.), bent upon extracting from it as much
moral significance as possible, says, θεραπευταὶ καὶ θεραπευτρίδες καλοῦνται,
ἤτοι παρ’ ὅσον ἰατρικὴν ἐπαγγέλλονται κρείσσονα τῆς κατὰ
πόλεις ἡ μὲν γὰρ σώματα θεραπεύει μόνον, ἐκείνη δὲ καὶ ψυχὰς κ.τ.λ.)
ἢ παρ’ ὅσον ἐκ φύσεως καὶ τῶν ἱερῶν νόμων ἐπαιδεύθησαν θεραπεύειν
τὸ ὃν κ.τ.λ.: but the latter meaning alone accords with the usage of
the word; for θεραπευτής, used absolutely, signifies ‘a worshipper,
devotee,’ not ‘a physician, healer.’ This etymology of Ἐσσαῖος is
ascribed, though wrongly, to Philo by Asaria di Rossi (<cite>Meor Enayim</cite>
3, fol. 33 <em>a</em>) and has been very widely received. Among more recent
writers, who have adopted or favoured it, are Bellermann (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ueber Essäer
u. Therapeuten</cite></span> p. 7), Gfrörer (<cite>Philo</cite> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 341), Dähne (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ersch u. Gruber</cite></span>,
s.v.), Baur (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Christl. Kirche der drei erst. Jahrh.</cite></span> p. 20), Herzfeld
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch. des Judenthums</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 371, 395, 397 sq.), Geiger (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Urschrift</cite></span>
p. 126), Derenbourg (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Histoire et la Géographie de la Palestine</cite></span>
pp. 170, 175, notes), Keim (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Jesus von Nazara</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 284 sq.), and
Hamburger (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Real-Encyclopädie für Bibel u. Talmud</cite></span>, s.v.). Several
of these writers identify the Essenes with the Baithusians (ביהוסין)
of the Talmud, though in the Talmud the Baithusians are connected
with the Sadducees. This identification was suggested by di Rossi
(l.c. fol. 33 <em>b</em>), who interprets ‘Baithusians’ as ‘the school of the
Essenes’ (ביח איסיא): while subsequent writers, going a step further,
have explained it ‘the school of the physicians’ (ביח איסיא).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(2) חזיא ‘a seer’;</div>

<p class='c000'>(2) חזא <em>chăzā</em> ‘to see’, whence חזיא <em>chazyā</em> ‘a seer’, in reference
to the prophetic powers which the Essenes claimed, as the
result of ascetic contemplation: Joseph. <cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 12 εἰσὶ δὲ ἐν αὐτοῖς
ὃι καὶ τὰ μέλλοντα προγινώσκειν ὑπισχνοῦνται κ.τ.λ. For instances of
such Essene prophets see <cite>Ant.</cite> xiii. <span class='fss'>II.</span> 2, xv. 10. 5, <cite>B.J.</cite>  <span class='fss'>I.</span> 3. 5, ii. 7.
3. Suidas, s.v. Ἐσσαῖοι, says: θεωρίᾳ τὰ πολλὰ παραμένουσιν, ἔνθεν
καὶ Ἐσσαῖοι καλοῦνται, τοῦτο δηλοῦντος τοῦ ὀνόματος, τουτέστι, θεωρητικοί.
For this derivation, which was suggested by Baumgarten
(see Bellermann p. 10) and is adopted by Hilgenfeld (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Jüd. Apocal.</cite></span>
p. 278), there is something to be said: but חזא is rather ὁρᾶν than
θεωρεῖν; and thus it must denote the result rather than the process,
the <em>vision</em> which was the privilege of the few rather than the <em>contemplation</em>
which was the duty of all. Indeed in a later paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr</cite></span>. XI. p. 346, 1868) Hilgenfeld expresses himself doubtfully
about this derivation, feeling the difficulty of explaining the σς
from the ז. This is a real objection. In the transliteration of the
<span class='fss'>LXX</span> the ז is persistently represented by ζ, and the צ by ς. The
exceptions to this rule, where the manuscript authority is beyond
question, are very few, and in every case they seem capable of explanation
by peculiar circumstances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(3) עשה ‘to do’;</div>

<p class='c000'>(3)  <em>عāsāh</em> ‘to do,’ so that Ἐσσαῖοι would signify ‘the
doers, the observers of the law,’ thus referring to the strictness of
Essene practices: see Oppenheim in Frankel’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Monatschrift</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VII.</span>
p. 272 sq. It has been suggested also that, as the Pharisees were
especially designated the teachers, the Essenes were called the ‘doers’
by a sort of antithesis: see an article in Jost’s <cite>Annalen</cite> 1839, p. 145.
Thus the talmudic phrase אנשי מעשה, interpreted ‘men of practice,
of good deeds,’ is supposed to refer to the Essenes (see Frankel’s
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschrift</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 458, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Monatschrift</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 70). In some passages indeed
(see Surenhuis <cite>Mishna</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 313) it may possibly mean ‘workers of
miracles’ (as ἔργον Joh. v. 20, vii. 21, x. 25, etc.); but in this sense
also it might be explained of the thaumaturgic powers claimed by the
Essenes. (See below, p. <a href='#Page_126'>126</a>.) On the use which has been made of a
passage in the <cite>Aboth</cite> of R. Nathan c. 37, as supporting this derivation,
I shall have to speak hereafter. Altogether this etymology has
little or nothing to recommend it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have reserved to the last the two derivations which seem to
deserve most consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(4) <em>chasyo</em> ‘pious’;</div>

‘pious,’ in
Syriac. This derivation, which is also given by de Sacy (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Chrestom.
Arab.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 347), is adopted by Ewald (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch. des V. Isr.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 484,
ed. 3, 1864, <span class='fss'>VII.</span> pp. 154, 477, ed. 2, 1859), who abandons in its favour
another etymology (הזן <em>chazzan</em> ‘watcher, worshipper’ = θεραπευτής)
which he had suggested in an earlier edition of his fourth
volume (p. 420). It is recommended by the fact that it resembles
not only in sound, but in meaning, the Greek ὅσιος, of which it is a
common rendering in the Peshito (Acts ii. 27, xiii. 35, Tit. i. 8).
Thus it explains the derivation given by Philo (see above, p. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>),
and it also accounts for the tendency to write Ὀσσαῖος for Ἐσσαῖος
in Greek. Ewald moreover points out how an Essenizing Sibylline
poem (<cite>Orac. Sib.</cite> iv; see above, p. 96) dwells on the Greek equivalents,
εὐσεβής, εὐσεβίη, etc. (vv. 26, 35, 42 sq., 148 sq., 162, 165 sq.,
178 sq., ed. Alexandre), as if they had a special value for the
writer: see <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VII.</span> p. 154, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Sibyll. Bücher</cite></span> p. 46. Lipsius (Schenkel’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Bibel-Lexikon</cite></span>, <em>s.v.</em>) also considers this the most probable etymology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(5) חשאים ‘silent ones.’</div>

<p class='c000'>(5) חשא <em>chāshā</em> (also <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חשה</span>) Heb., ‘to be silent’; whence <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חשאים</span>
<em>chashshāīm</em> ‘the silent ones,’ who meditate on mysteries. Jost (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch.
d. Judenth.</cite></span> I. p. 207) believes that this was the derivation accepted
by Josephus, since he elsewhere (<cite>Ant.</cite> iii. 7. 5, iii. 8. 9) writes out חשן,
<em>chōshen</em> ‘the high-priest’s breast-plate’ (Exod. xxviii. 15 sq), ἐσσήν or
ἐσσήνης in Greek, and explains it σημαίνει, τοῦτο κατὰ τὴν Ἑλλήνων
γλῶτταν λογεῖον (i.e. the ‘place of oracles’ or ‘of reason’: comp. Philo
<cite>de Mon.</cite> ii. § 5, II. p. 226 καλεῖται λογεῖον ἐτύμως, ἐπειδὴ τὰ ἐν οὐρανῷ
πάντα λόγοις καὶ ἀναλογίαις δεδημιούργηται κ.τ.λ.), as it is translated
in the LXX. Even though modern critics should be right in connecting
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חשן</span> with the Arab.

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘pulcher fuit, ornavit’</span> (see Gesen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Thes.</cite></span>
p. 535, s.v.), the other derivation may have prevailed in Josephus’
time. We may illustrate this derivation by Josephus’ description of
the Essenes, <cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 5 τοῖς ἔξωθεν ὡς μυστήριόν τι φρικτὸν ἡ τῶν
ἔνδον σιωπὴ καταφαίνεται; and perhaps this will also explain the Greek
equivalent θεωρητικοί, which Suidas gives for Ἐσσαῖοι. The use of
the Hebrew word <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חשאים</span> in Mishna <cite>Shekalim</cite> v. 6, though we need
not suppose that the Essenes are there meant, will serve to show how
it might be adopted as the name of the sect. On this word see Levy
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Chaldäisches Wörterbuch</cite></span> p. 287. On the whole this seems the most
probable etymology of any, though it has not found so much favour
as the last. At all events the rules of transliteration are entirely
satisfied, and this can hardly be said of the other derivations which
come into competition with it.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>2. <br /> ORIGIN AND AFFINITIES OF THE ESSENES.</h3>

<div class='sidenote c002'>The principle of the restoration.</div>

<p class='c000'>The ruling principle of the Restoration under Ezra was the isolation
of the Jewish people from all influences of the surrounding
nations.  Only by the  rigorous application of this principle was it
possible to guard the nationality of the Hebrews, and thus to preserve
the sacred deposit of religious truth of which this nationality was the
husk.  Hence the strictest attention was paid to the Levitical ordinances,
and more especially to those which aimed at ceremonial
purity.  The principle, which was thus distinctly asserted at the
period of the national revival, gained force and concentration at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>later date from the active antagonism to which the patriotic Jews
were driven by the religious and political aggressions of the Syrian
kings. During the Maccabæan wars we read of a party or sect
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rise of the Asidæans.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
called the <em>Chasidim</em> or <em>Asidæans</em> (Ἀσιδαῖοι), the ‘pious’ or ‘devout,’
who zealous in their observance of the ceremonial law stoutly resisted
any concession to the practices of Hellenism, and took their
place in the van of the struggle with their national enemies, the
Antiochene monarchs (1 Macc. ii. 42, vii. 13, 2 Macc. xiv. 6). But,
though their names appear now for the first time, they are not mentioned
as a newly formed party; and it is probable that they had their
origin at a much earlier date.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subsequent history of this tendency to exclusiveness and
isolation is wrapt in the same obscurity. At a somewhat later date
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pharisaism and Essenism traced to the same principle.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it is exhibited in the <em>Pharisees</em> and the <em>Essenes</em>; but whether these
were historically connected with the Chasidim as divergent offshoots
of the original sect, or whether they represent independent developments
of the same principle, we are without the proper data for
deciding. The principle itself appears in the name of the Pharisees,
which, as denoting ‘separation,’ points to the avoidance of all foreign
and contaminating influences. On the other hand the meaning of
the name <em>Essene</em> is uncertain, for the attempt to derive it directly
from <em>Chasidim</em> must be abandoned; but the tendency of the sect is
unmistakeable. If with the Pharisees ceremonial purity was a
principal aim, with the Essenes it was an absorbing passion. It was
enforced and guarded moreover by a special organization. While the
Pharisees were a sect, the Essenes were an order. Like the Pythagoreans
in Magna Græcia and the Buddhists in India before them,
like the Christian monks of the Egyptian and Syrian deserts after
them, they were formed into a religious brotherhood, fenced about
by minute and rigid rules, and carefully guarded from any contamination
with the outer world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Foreign elements in Essenism.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus the sect may have arisen in the heart of Judaism. The
idea of ceremonial purity was essentially Judaic. But still, when we
turn to the representations of Philo and Josephus, it is impossible to
overlook other traits which betoken foreign affinities. Whatever the
Essenes may have been in their origin, at the Christian era at least
and in the Apostolic age they no longer represented the current type
of religious thought and practice among the Jews. This foreign
element has been derived by some from the Pythagoreans, by others
from the Syrians or Persians or even from the farther East; but,
whether Greek or Oriental, its existence has until lately been almost
universally allowed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Frankel’s theory well received,</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The investigations of Frankel, published first in 1846 in his
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschrift</cite></span>, and continued in 1853 in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Monatschrift</cite></span>, have given a
different direction to current opinion. Frankel maintains that
Essenism was a purely indigenous growth, that it is only Pharisaism
in an exaggerated form, and that it has nothing distinctive and owes
nothing, or next to nothing, to foreign influences. To establish this
point, he disparages the representations of Philo and Josephus as
coloured to suit the tastes of their heathen readers, while in their
place he brings forward as authorities a number of passages from talmudical
and rabbinical writings, in which he discovers references to
this sect. In this view he is followed implicitly by some later
writers, and has largely influenced the opinions of others; while nearly
all speak of his investigations as throwing great light on the
subject.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>but groundless and misleading.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is perhaps dangerous to dissent from a view which has found
so much favour; but nevertheless I am obliged to confess my belief
that, whatever value Frankel’s investigations may have as contributions
to our knowledge of Jewish religious thought and practice, they
throw little or no light on the Essenes specially; and that the blind
acceptance of his results by later writers has greatly obscured the
distinctive features of this sect. I cannot but think that any one,
who will investigate Frankel’s references and test his results step by
step, will arrive at the conclusion to which I myself have been led,
that his talmudical researches have left our knowledge of this sect
where it was before, and that we must still refer to Josephus and
Philo for any precise information respecting them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His double derivation of the name.</div>

<p class='c000'>Frankel starts from the etymology of the name. He supposes
that Ἐσσαῖος, Ἐσσηνός, represent two different Hebrew words, the
former <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חסיד</span> <em>chāsīd</em>, the latter <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">צנוע</span> <em>tsanūaع</em>, both clothed in suitable
Greek dresses<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c016'><sup>[339]</sup></a>. Wherever therefore either of these words
occurs, there is, or there may be, a direct reference to the
Essenes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fatal objections to it.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not too much to say that these etymologies are impossible;
and this for several reasons. (1) The two words Ἐσσαῖος, Ἐσσηνός,
are plainly duplicate forms of the same Hebrew or Aramaic
original, like Σαμψαῖος and Σαμψηνός (Epiphan. <cite>Hær.</cite> pp. 40, 47,
127; and even Σαμψίτης p. 46), Ναζωραῖος and Ναζαρηνός, Γιτταῖος
and Γιττηνός (Steph. Byz. s.v., Hippol. <cite>Hær.</cite> vi. 7), with which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>may compare Βοστραῖος and Βοστρηνός, Μελιταῖος and Μελιτηνός, and
numberless other examples. (2) Again; when we consider either
word singly, the derivation offered is attended with the most serious
difficulties. There is no reason why in Ἐσσαῖος the <em>d</em> should have
disappeared from <em>chasid</em>, while it is hardly possible to conceive that
tsanuaع should have taken such an incongruous form as Ἐσσηνός.
(3) And lastly; the more important of the two words, <em>chasid</em>, had
already a recognised Greek equivalent in Ἀσιδαῖος; and it seems
highly improbable that a form so divergent as Ἐσσαῖος should have
taken its place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dependence of the theory on the derivation.</div>

<p class='c000'>Indeed Frankel’s derivations are generally, if not universally,
abandoned by later writers; and yet these same writers repeat his
quotations and accept his results, as if the references were equally valid,
though the name of the sect has disappeared. They seem to be
satisfied with the stability of the edifice, even when the foundation
is undermined. Thus for instance Grätz not only maintains after
Frankel that the Essenes ‘were properly nothing more than stationary
or, more strictly speaking, consistently logical (consequente)
<em>Chasidim</em>,’ and ‘that therefore they were not so far removed from the
Pharisees that they can be regarded as a separate sect,’ and ‘accepts
entirely these results’ which, as he says, ‘rest on critical investigation’
(<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 463), but even boldly translates <em>chasiduth</em> ‘the
Essene mode of life’ (ib. 84), though he himself gives a wholly
different derivation of the word ‘Essene,’ making it signify ‘washers’
or ‘baptists’ (see above, p. <a href='#Page_116'>116</a>). And even those who do not go to
this length of inconsistency, yet avail themselves freely of the
passages where <em>chasid</em> occurs, and interpret it of the Essenes, while
distinctly repudiating the etymology<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c016'><sup>[340]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The term <em>chasid</em> not applied specially to the Essenes.</div>

<p class='c000'>But, although Ἐσσαῖος or Ἐσσηνός is not a Greek form of <em>chasid</em>,
it might still happen that this word was applied to them as an
epithet, though not as a proper name. Only in this case the reference
ought to be unmistakeable, before any conclusions are based
upon it. But in fact, after going through all the passages which
Frankel gives, it is impossible to feel satisfied that in a single instance
there is a direct allusion to the Essenes. Sometimes the word
seems to refer to the old sect of the <em>Chasidim</em> or <em>Asidæans</em>, as for
instance when Jose ben Joezer, who lived during the Maccabæan war,
is called a <em>chasid</em><a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c016'><sup>[341]</sup></a>. At all events this R. Jose is known to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>been a married man, for he is stated to have disinherited his children
(<cite>Baba Bathra</cite> 133 <em>b</em>); and therefore he cannot have belonged to the
stricter order of Essenes. Sometimes it is employed quite generally
to denote pious observers of the ceremonial law, as for instance
when it is said that with the death of certain famous teachers the
Chasidim ceased<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c016'><sup>[342]</sup></a>. In this latter sense the expression <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חסידים הראשונים</span>,
‘the ancient or primitive Chasidim’ (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Monatschr.</cite></span> pp. 31, 62), is perhaps
used; for these primitive Chasidim again are mentioned as having
wives and children<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c016'><sup>[343]</sup></a>, and it appears also that they were scrupulously
exact in bringing their sacrificial offerings<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c016'><sup>[344]</sup></a>. Thus it is impossible to
identify them with the Essenes, as described by Josephus and Philo.
Even in those passages of which most has been made, the reference
is more than doubtful. Thus great stress is laid on the saying of R.
Joshua ben Chananiah in Mishna <em>Sotah</em> iii. 4, ‘The foolish <em>chasid</em> and
the clever villain (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חסיד שוטה ורשע ערום</span>), etc., are the ruin of the world.’
But the connexion points to a much more general meaning of <em>chasid</em>,
and the rendering in Surenhuis, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Homo pius qui insipiens, improbus
qui astutus,’</span> gives the correct antithesis. So we might say that
there is no one more mischievous than the wrong-headed conscientious
man. It is true that the Gemaras illustrate the expression by examples
of those who allow an over-punctilious regard for external
forms to stand in the way of deeds of mercy. And perhaps rightly.
But there is no reference to any distinctive Essene practices in the
illustrations given. Again; the saying in Mishna <cite>Pirke Aboth</cite> v.
10, ‘He who says Mine is thine and thine is thine is [a] <em>chasid</em>
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">שלי שלך ושלך שלך הסיד</span>),’ is quoted by several writers as though it
referred to the Essene community of goods<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c016'><sup>[345]</sup></a>. But in the first place
the idea of community of goods would require ‘Mine is thine and
thine is mine’: and in the second place, the whole context, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>especially the clause which immediately follows (and which these
writers do not give), ‘He who says Thine is mine and mine is
mine is wicked (רשע),’ show plainly that חסיד must be taken in its
general sense ‘pious,’ and the whole expression implies not reciprocal
interchange but individual self-denial.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Possible connexion of<br /><em>chasid</em> and <em>chasyo</em><br />discussed.</div>

<p class='c000'>It might indeed be urged, though this is not Frankel’s plea, that
supposing the true etymology of the word Ἐσσαῖος, Ἐσσηνός, to be
the Syriac
<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܚܣܐ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/chse.jpg' alt='chse' /></span>,

<em>ch’sē</em>, <em>chasyo</em> (a possible derivation),
<em>chasid</em> might have been its Hebrew equivalent as being similar
in sound and meaning, and perhaps ultimately connected in derivation,
the exactly corresponding triliteral root <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חסא</span> (comp. <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חום</span>) not
being in use in Hebrew<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c016'><sup>[346]</sup></a>. But before we accept this explanation
we have a right to demand some evidence which, if not demonstrative,
is at least circumstantial, that <em>chasid</em> is used of the Essenes:
and this we have seen is not forthcoming. Moreover, if the Essenes
had thus inherited the name of the <em>Chasidim</em>, we should have expected
that its old Greek equivalent Ἀσιδαῖοι, which is still used
later than the Maccabæan era, would also have gone with it; rather
than that a new Greek word Ἐσσαῖος (or Ἐσσηνός) should have been
invented to take its place. But indeed the Syriac Version of the
Old Testament furnishes an argument against this convertibility of
the Hebrew <em>chasid</em> and the Syriac <em>chasyo</em>, which must be regarded as
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Usage is unfavourable to this view.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
almost decisive. The numerous passages in the Psalms, where the
expressions ‘My <em>chasidim</em>,’ ‘His <em>chasidim</em>,’ occur (xxx. 5, xxxi. 24,
xxxvii. 28, lii. 11, lxxix. 2, lxxxv. 9, xcvii. 10, cxvi. 15, cxxxii. 9,
cxlix. 9: comp. xxxii. 6, cxlix. 1, 5) seem to have suggested the
assumption of the name to the original Asidæans. But in such
passages <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חסיד</span> is commonly, if not universally, rendered in the
Peshito not by
<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܚܣܐ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/chse.jpg' alt='chse' /></span>,

but by a wholly different word
 <span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܙܕܝܩ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/zadik.jpg' alt='zadik' /></span>
<em>zadīk</em>. And again, in the Books of Maccabees the Syriac rendering
for the name Ἀσιδαῖοι, <em>Chasidim</em>, is a word derived from another
quite distinct root. These facts show that the Hebrew <em>chasid</em> and
the Syriac <em>chasyo</em> were not practically equivalents, so that the one
would suggest the other; and thus all presumption in favour of a
connexion between Ἀσιδαῖος and Ἐσσαῖος is removed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Frankel’s second derivation</div>

<p class='c000'>Frankel’s other derivation <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">צנוע</span>, <em>tsanūaع</em>, suggested as an equivalent
to Ἐσσηνός, has found no favour with later writers, and
indeed is too far removed from the Greek form to be tenable.

<p class='c000'>Nor do the passages quoted by him<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c016'><sup>[347]</sup></a> require or suggest any allusion
to this sect. Thus in Mishna <cite>Demai</cite>, vi. 6, we are told that the
school of Hillel permits a certain license in a particular matter, but
it is added, ‘The <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">צנועי</span> of the school of Hillel followed the precept
of the school of Shammai.’ Here, as Frankel himself confesses,
the Jerusalem Talmud knows nothing about Essenes, but explains
the word by <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בשדי</span>, i.e. ‘upright, worthy<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c016'><sup>[348]</sup></a>’; while elsewhere, as he
allows<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c016'><sup>[349]</sup></a>, it must have this general sense. Indeed the mention of the
‘school of Hillel’ here seems to exclude the Essenes. In its comprehensive
meaning it will most naturally be taken also in the other
passage quoted by Frankel, <cite>Kiddushin</cite> 71 <em>a</em>, where it is stated that
the pronunciation of the sacred name, which formerly was known to
all, is now only to be divulged to the <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">צנועים</span>, i.e. the discreet, among
the priests; and in fact it occurs in reference to the communication
of the same mystery in the immediate context also, where it could
not possibly be treated as a proper name; <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">שצנוע ועניו ועומד בחצי ימיו</span>,
‘who is <em>discreet</em> and meek and has reached middle age,’ etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other supposed etymologies in the Talmud. (1) <em>Asya</em> ‘a physician,’</div>

<p class='c000'>Of other etymologies, which have been suggested, and through
which it might be supposed the Essenes are mentioned by name in
the Talmud, <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">איסא</span>, <em>asya</em>, ‘a physician,’ is the one which has found
most favour. For the reasons given above (p. 117) this derivation
seems highly improbable, and the passages quoted are quite insufficient
to overcome the objections. Of these the strongest is in the
Talm. Jerus. <em>Yoma</em> iii. 7, where we are told that a certain physician</p>
<div class='sidenote'>not supported by the passages quoted in its behalf.</div>
<p class='c000'>(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אסי</span>) offered to communicate the sacred name to R. Pinchas the
son of Chama, and the latter refused on the ground that he ate of
the tithes—this being regarded as a disqualification, apparently
because it was inconsistent with the highest degree of ceremonial
purity<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c016'><sup>[350]</sup></a>. The same story is told with some modifications in Midrash
<cite>Qoheleth</cite> iii. 11<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c016'><sup>[351]</sup></a>. Here Frankel, though himself (as we have seen)
adopting a different derivation of the word ‘Essene,’ yet supposes
that this particular physician belonged to the sect, on the sole ground
that ceremonial purity is represented as a qualification for the
initiation into the mystery of the Sacred Name. Löwy (l.c.) denies
that the allusion to the tithes is rightly interpreted: but even supposing
it to be correct, the passage is quite an inadequate basis either
for Frankel’s conclusion that this particular physician was an Essene,
or for the derivation of the word Essene which others maintain. Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>in the statement of Talm. Jerus. <cite>Kethuboth</cite> ii. 3, that correct manuscripts
were called books of <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אסי</span><a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c016'><sup>[352]</sup></a>, the word <em>Asi</em> is generally taken as
a proper name. But even if this interpretation be false, there is absolutely
nothing in the context which suggests any allusion to the
Essenes<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c016'><sup>[353]</sup></a>. In like manner the passage from <em>Sanhedrin</em> 99 <em>b</em>, where
a physician is mentioned<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c016'><sup>[354]</sup></a>, supports no such inference. Indeed, as
this last passage relates to the family of the <em>Asi</em>, he obviously can
have had no connexion with the celibate Essenes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(2) <em>عasah</em> ‘to do.’</div>

<p class='c000'>Hitherto our search for the name in the Talmud has been unsuccessful.
One possibility however still remains. The talmudical
writers speak of certain <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אנשי מעשה</span>  ‘men of deeds’; and if (as some
suppose) the name Essene is derived from <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">עשה</span>, have we not here the
mention which we are seeking? Frankel rejects the etymology,
but presses the identification<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c016'><sup>[355]</sup></a>. The expression, he urges, is often
used in connexion with <em>chasidim</em>. It signifies ‘miracle workers,’
and therefore aptly describes the supernatural powers supposed to be
exercised by the Essenes<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c016'><sup>[356]</sup></a>. Thus we are informed in Mishna <cite>Sotah</cite> ix.
15, that ‘When R. Chaninah ben Dosa died, the men of deeds ceased;
when R. Jose Ketinta died, the chasidim ceased.’ In the Jerusalem
Talmud however this mishna is read, ‘With the death of R. Chaninah
ben Dosa and R. Jose Ketinta the chasidim ceased’; while the
Gemara there explains R. Chaninah to have been one of the <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"> מעשה אנשי</span>.
Thus, Frankel concludes, ‘the identity of these with <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">הסידים</span>
becomes still more plain.’ Now it seems clear that this expression
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אנשי מעשה</span> in some places cannot refer to miraculous powers, but
must mean ‘men of practical goodness,’ as for instance in <em>Succah</em>
51<em>a</em>, 53<em>a</em>; and being a general term expressive of moral excellence,
it is naturally connected with <em>chasidim</em>, which is likewise a general
term expressive of piety and goodness. Nor is there any reason why
it should not always be taken in this sense. It is true that stories
are told elsewhere of this R. Chaninah, which ascribe miraculous
powers to him<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c016'><sup>[357]</sup></a>, and hence there is a temptation to translate it ‘wonder-worker,’
as applied to him. But the reason is quite insufficient.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Moreover it must be observed that R. Chaninah’s wife is a prominent
person in the legends of his miracles reported in <cite>Taanith</cite> 24 <em>b</em>;
and thus we need hardly stop to discuss the possible meanings of
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אנשי מעשה</span>, since his claims to being considered an Essene are barred
at the outset by this fact<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c016'><sup>[358]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been asserted indeed by a recent author, that one very
ancient Jewish writer distinctly adopts this derivation, and as distinctly
states that the Essenes were a class of Pharisees<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c016'><sup>[359]</sup></a>. If this
were the case, Frankel’s theory, though not his etymology, would
receive a striking confirmation: and it is therefore important to
enquire on what foundation the assertion rests.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The authority for this derivation traced to an error.</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr Ginsburg’s authority for this statement is a passage from
the <cite>Aboth</cite> of Rabbi Nathan, c. 37, which, as he gives it, appears
conclusive; ‘There are eight kinds of Pharisees ... and those Pharisees
who live in celibacy are Essenes.’ But what are the facts
of the case? <em>First</em>; This book was certainly not written by its
reputed author, the R. Nathan who was vice-president under the
younger Gamaliel about <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 140. It may possibly have been
founded on an earlier treatise by that famous teacher, though even
this is very doubtful: but in its present form it is a comparatively
modern work. On this point all or almost all recent writers
on Hebrew literature are agreed<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c016'><sup>[360]</sup></a>. <em>Secondly</em>; Dr Ginsburg has taken
the reading <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">מחופתו עשאני</span>, without even mentioning any alternative.
Whether the words so read are capable of the meaning which he
has assigned to them, may be highly questionable; but at all events
this cannot have been the original reading, as the parallel passages,
Babl. Sotah fol. 22<em>b</em>, Jerus. <cite>Sotah</cite> v. 5, Jerus. <cite>Berakhoth</cite> ix. 5,
(quoted by Buxtorf and Levy, s.v. <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">פריש</span>), distinctly prove. In
Babl. <em>Sotah</em> l.c., the corresponding expression is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">מה הובתי ואעשנה</span>
‘What is my duty, and I will do it,’ and the passage in Jerus.
<em>Berakhoth</em> l.c. is to the same effect. These parallels show that
the reading <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">מה הובתי ואעשנה</span> must be taken also in <cite>Aboth</cite> c. 37,
so that the passage will be rendered, ‘The Pharisee <em>who says</em>, What
is my duty, and I will do it.’ Thus the Essenes and celibacy disappear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>together. <em>Lastly</em>; Inasmuch as Dr Ginsburg himself takes a
wholly different view of the name Essene, connecting it either with
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חצן</span> ‘an apron,’ or with <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">הסים</span> ‘pious<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c016'><sup>[361]</sup></a>,’ it is difficult to see how he could
translate <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">עשאני</span> ‘Essene’ (from <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">עשא</span> ‘to do’) in this passage, except
on the supposition that R. Nathan was entirely ignorant of the
orthography and derivation of the word Essene. Yet, if such ignorance
were conceivable in so ancient a writer, his authority on this
question would be absolutely worthless. But indeed Dr Ginsburg
would appear to have adopted this reference to R. Nathan, with the
reading of the passage and the interpretation of the name, from
some other writer<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c016'><sup>[362]</sup></a>. At all events it is quite inconsistent with
his own opinion as expressed previously.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Are the Essenes alluded to, though not named, in the Talmud?</div>

<p class='c000'>But, though we have not succeeded in finding any direct mention
of this sect by name in the Talmud, and all the identifications
of the word Essene with diverse expressions occurring there
have failed us on examination, it might still happen that allusions
to them were so frequent as to leave no doubt about the persons
meant. Their organisation or their practices or their tenets might
be precisely described, though their name was suppressed. Such
allusions Frankel finds scattered up and down the Talmud in great
profusion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(1) The <em>chaber</em> or Associate.</div>

<p class='c000'>(1) He sees a reference to the Essenes in the <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חבורא</span> <em>chăbūra</em> or
‘Society,’ which is mentioned several times in talmudical writers<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c016'><sup>[363]</sup></a>.
The <em>chāber</em> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">הבר</span>) or ‘Associate’ is, he supposes, a member of this
brotherhood. He is obliged to confess that the word cannot always
have this sense, but still he considers this to be a common designation
of the Essenes. The chaber was bound to observe certain
rules of ceremonial purity, and a period of probation was imposed
upon him before he was admitted. With this fact Frankel connects
the passage in Mishna <cite>Chagigah</cite> ii. 5, 6, where several degrees of ceremonial
purity are specified. Having done this, he considers that he
has the explanation of the statement in Josephus (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 7, 10),
that the Essenes were divided into four different grades or orders
according to the time of their continuance in the ascetic practices
demanded by the sect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A passage in <em>Chagigah</em> considered.</div>

<p class='c000'>But in the first place there is no reference direct or indirect
to the chaber, or indeed to any organisation of any kind, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>passage of <em>Chagigah</em>. It simply contemplates different degrees of
purification as qualifying for the performance of certain Levitical
rites in an ascending scale. There is no indication that these
lustrations are more than temporary and immediate in their application;
and not the faintest hint is given of distinct orders of men,
each separated from the other by formal barriers and each demanding
a period of probation before admission from the order below,
as was the case with the grades of the Essene brotherhood described
by Josephus. Moreover the orders in Josephus are four in number<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c016'><sup>[364]</sup></a>,
while the degrees of ceremonial purity in <cite>Chagigah</cite> are five. Frankel
indeed is inclined to maintain that only four degrees are intended
in <cite>Chagigah</cite>, though this interpretation is opposed to the plain sense
of the passage. But, even if he should be obliged to grant that the
number of degrees is five<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c016'><sup>[365]</sup></a>, he will not surrender the allusion to the
Essenes, but meets the difficulty by supposing (it is a pure hypothesis)
that there was a fifth and highest degree of purity among the Essenes,
to which very few attained, and which, as I understand him, is not
mentioned by Josephus on this account. But enough has already
been said to show, that this passage in <cite>Chagigah</cite> can have no connexion
with the Essenes and gives no countenance to Frankel’s
views.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Difference between</div>

<p class='c000'>As this artificial combination has failed, we are compelled to
fall back on the notices relating to the chaber, and to ask whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>the chaber and the Essene.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
these suggest any connexion with the account of the Essenes in
Josephus. And the facts oblige us to answer this question in the
negative. Not only do they not suggest such a connexion, but they
are wholly irreconcilable with the account in the Jewish historian.
This association or confraternity (if indeed the term is applicable
to an organisation so loose and so comprehensive) was maintained
for the sake of securing a more accurate study and a better observance
of the ceremonial law. Two grades of purity are mentioned
in connexion with it, designated by different names and presenting
some difficulties<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c016'><sup>[366]</sup></a>, into which it is not necessary to enter here.
A chaber, it would appear, was one who had entered upon the
second or higher stage. For this a period of a year’s probation was
necessary. The chaber enrolled himself in the presence of three
others who were already members of the association. This apparently
was all the formality necessary: and in the case of a teacher
even this was dispensed with, for being presumably acquainted with
the law of things clean and unclean he was regarded as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ex officio</em></span>
a chaber. The chaber was bound to keep himself from ceremonial
defilements, and was thus distinguished from the <em>[عam haarets</em>
or common people<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c016'><sup>[367]</sup></a>; but he was under no external surveillance and
decided for himself as to his own purity. Moreover he was, or
might be a married man: for the doctors disputed whether the
wives and children of an associate were not themselves to be
regarded as associates<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c016'><sup>[368]</sup></a>. In one passage, <cite>Sanhedrin</cite> 41<em>a</em>, it is even
assumed, as a matter of course, that a woman may be an associate
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חברה</span>). In another (<cite>Niddah</cite> 33<em>b</em>)<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c016'><sup>[369]</sup></a> there is mention of a Sadducee
and even of a Samaritan as a chaber. An organisation so flexible as
this has obviously only the most superficial resemblances with the
rigid rules of the Essene order; and in many points it presents a
direct contrast to the characteristic tenets of that sect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(2) The <em>Bene hakkeneseth</em>.</div>

<p class='c000'>(2) Having discussed Frankel’s hypothesis respecting the chaber,
I need hardly follow his speculations on the <em>Bĕnē-hakkĕneseth</em>,
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בני הכנסח</span>, ‘sons of the congregation’ (<cite>Zabim</cite> iii. 2), in which expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>probably few would discover the reference, which he finds,
to the lowest of the Essene orders<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c016'><sup>[370]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(3) The ‘holy congregation at Jerusalem’</div>

<p class='c000'>(3) But mention is also made of a ‘holy congregation’ or ‘assembly’
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">עדה קדישה קהלא קדישא</span>) ‘in Jerusalem’; and, following
Rapoport, Frankel sees in this expression also an allusion to the
Essenes<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c016'><sup>[371]</sup></a>. The grounds for this identification are, that in one passage
(<cite>Berakhoth</cite> 9<em>b</em>) they are mentioned in connexion with prayer at
day break, and in another (Midrash <cite>Qoheleth</cite> ix. 9) two persons are
stated to belong to this ‘holy congregation,’ because they divided
their day into three parts, devoting one-third to learning, another
to prayer, and another to work. The first notice would suit the
Essenes very well, though the practice mentioned was not so distinctively
Essene as to afford any safe ground for this hypothesis. Of
the second it should be observed, that no such division of the day is
recorded of the Essenes, and indeed both Josephus (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 5)
and Philo (<cite>Fragm.</cite> p. 633) describe them as working from morning
till night with the single interruption of their mid-day meal<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c016'><sup>[372]</sup></a>. But
in fact the identification is beset with other and more serious difficulties.
For this ‘holy congregation’ at Jerusalem is mentioned long
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>not an Essene community.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
after the second destruction of the city under Hadrian<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c016'><sup>[373]</sup></a>, when on
Frankel’s own showing<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c016'><sup>[374]</sup></a> the Essene society had in all probability
ceased to exist. And again certain members of it, e.g. Jose ben
Meshullam (Mishna <cite>Bekhoroth</cite> iii. 3, vi. 1), are represented as uttering
precepts respecting animals fit for sacrifice, though we have it on
the authority of Josephus and Philo that the Essenes avoided the
temple sacrifices altogether. The probability therefore seems to be
that this ‘holy congregation’ was an assemblage of devout Jews
who were drawn to the neighbourhood of the sanctuary after the
destruction of the nation, and whose practices were regarded with
peculiar reverence by the later Jews<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c016'><sup>[375]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(4) The <cite>Vethikin</cite>.</div>

<p class='c000'>(4) Neither can we with Frankel<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c016'><sup>[376]</sup></a> discern any reference to the
Essenes in those <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">ותיקיו</span> <em>Vethikin</em>, ‘pious’ or ‘learned’ men (whatever
may be the exact sense of the word), who are mentioned in <cite>Berakhoth</cite>
9<em>b</em> as praying before sunrise; because the word itself seems quite
general, and the practice, though enforced among the Essenes, as
we know from Josephus (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 5), would be common to all
devout and earnest Jews. If we are not justified in saying that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>these <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">ותיקיו</span> were not Essenes, we have no sufficient grounds for
maintaining that they were.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(5) The ‘primitive elders.’</div>

<p class='c000'>(5) Nor again can we find any such reference in the <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">זקנים</span>
or ‘primitive elders<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c016'><sup>[377]</sup></a>.’ It may readily be granted that this
term is used synonymously, or nearly so, with <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">הראשונים הסידים</span>
‘the primitive chasidim’; but, as we failed to see anything more
than a general expression in the one, so we are naturally led to
take the other in the same sense. The passages where the expression
occurs (e.g. <cite>Shabbath</cite> 64<em>b</em>) simply refer to the stricter observances
of early times, and do not indicate any reference to a particular
society or body of men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(6) The ‘morning bathers.’</div>

<p class='c000'>(6) Again Frankel finds another reference to this sect in the
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">טבלי שחרית</span> <em>Tōblē-shachărīth</em>, or ‘morning-bathers,’ mentioned in
Tosifta <cite>Yadayim</cite> c. 2<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c016'><sup>[378]</sup></a>. The identity of these with the ἡμεροβαπτισταὶ
of Greek writers seems highly probable. The latter however,
though they may have had some affinities with Essene practices
and tenets, are nevertheless distinguished from this sect wherever
they are mentioned<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c016'><sup>[379]</sup></a>. But the point to be observed is that, even
though we should identify these Toble-shacharith with the Essenes,
the passage in Tosifta <cite>Yadayim</cite>, so far from favouring, runs directly
counter to Frankel’s view which regards the Essenes as only a branch
of Pharisees: for the two are here represented as in direct antagonism.
The Toble-shacharith say, ‘We grieve over you, Pharisees,
because you pronounce the (sacred) Name in the morning without
having bathed.’ The Pharisees retort, ‘We grieve over you, Toble-shacharith,
because you pronounce the Name from this body in which
is impurity.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(7) The <em>Banaim</em>.</div>

<p class='c000'>(7) In connexion with the Toble-shacharith we may consider
another name, <em>Banāīm</em> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בנאים</span>), in which also Frankel discovers
an allusion to the Essenes<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c016'><sup>[380]</sup></a>. In Mishna <cite>Mikvaoth</cite> ix. 6 the word
is opposed to <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בור</span> <em>bōr</em>, ‘an ignorant or stupid person’; and this
points to its proper meaning ‘the builders,’ i.e. the edifiers or
teachers, according to the common metaphor in Biblical language.
The word is discussed in <cite>Shabbath</cite> 114 and explained to mean
‘learned.’ But, because in <cite>Mikvaoth</cite> it is mentioned in connexion
with ceremonial purity, and because in Josephus the Essenes are
stated to have carried an ‘axe and shovel’ (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 7, 9), and because
moreover the Jewish historian in another place (<cite>Vit.</cite> 2) mentions
having spent some time with one Banus a dweller in the wilderness,
who lived on vegetables and fruits and bathed often day and night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>for the sake of purity, and who is generally considered to have been
an Essene; therefore Frankel holds these Banaim to have been Essenes.
This is a specimen of the misplaced ingenuity which distinguishes
Frankel’s learned speculations on the Essenes. Josephus does
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Josephus misinterpreted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not mention an ‘axe <em>and</em> shovel,’ but an axe only (§ 7 ἀξινάριον),
which he afterwards defines more accurately as a spade (§ 9 τῇ
σκαλίδι, τοιοῦτον γάρ ἐστι τὸ διδόμενον ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἀξινίδιον τοῖς νεοσυστάτοις)
and which, as he distinctly states, was given them for the
purpose of burying impurities out of sight (comp. Deut. xxiii. 12–14).
Thus it has no connexion whatever with any ‘building’ implement.
And again, it is true that Banus has frequently been regarded as
an Essene, but there is absolutely no ground for this supposition.
On the contrary the narrative of Josephus in his <cite>Life</cite> seems to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Another derivation of Banaim.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
exclude it, as I shall have occasion to show hereafter<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c016'><sup>[381]</sup></a>. I should add
that Sachs interprets Banaim ‘the bathers,’ regarding the explanation
in <cite>Shabbath</cite> l.c. as a ‘later accommodation<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c016'><sup>[382]</sup></a>.’ This seems to me very
improbable; but, if it were conceded, the Banaim would then apparently
be connected not with the Essenes, but with the Hemerobaptists.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Results of this investigation.</div>

<p class='c000'>From the preceding investigation it will have appeared how
little Frankel has succeeded in establishing his thesis that ‘the
talmudical sources are acquainted with the Essenes and make
mention of them constantly<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c016'><sup>[383]</sup></a>.’ We have seen not only that no
instance of the name Essene has been produced, but that all those
passages which are supposed to refer to them under other designations,
or to describe their practices or tenets, fail us on closer examination.
In no case can we feel sure that there is any direct
reference to this sect, while in most cases such reference seems to be
excluded by the language or the attendant circumstances<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c016'><sup>[384]</sup></a>. Thus we are
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Philo and Josephus our main authorities.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
obliged to fall back upon the representations of Philo and Josephus.
Their accounts are penned by eye-witnesses. They are direct and
explicit, if not so precise or so full as we could have wished. The
writers obviously consider that they are describing a distinct and
exceptional phenomenon. And it would be a reversal of all established
rules of  historical criticism to desert the solid standing-ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of contemporary history for the artificial combinations and
shadowy hypotheses, which Frankel would substitute in its place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Frankel’s depreciation of them is unreasonable, and explains nothing.</div>

<p class='c000'>But here we are confronted with Frankel’s depreciation of these
ancient writers, which has been echoed by several later critics. They
were interested, it is argued, in making their accounts attractive
to their heathen contemporaries, and they coloured them highly
for this purpose<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c016'><sup>[385]</sup></a>. We may readily allow that they would not be
uninfluenced by such a motive, but the concession does not touch the
main points at issue. This aim might have led Josephus, for example,
to throw into bold relief the coincidences between the Essenes and
Pythagoreans; it might even have induced him to give a semi-pagan
tinge to the Essene doctrine of the future state of the blessed (<cite>B.J.</cite>
ii. 8. 11). But it entirely fails to explain those peculiarities of the
sect, which marked them off by a sharp line from orthodox Judaism,
and which fully justify the term ‘separatists’ as applied to them
by a recent writer. In three main features especially the portrait of
the Essenes retains its distinctive character unaffected by this consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) The avoidance of sacrifices is not accounted for.</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) How, for instance, could this principle of accommodation have
led both Philo and Josephus to lay so much stress on their divergence
from Judaic orthodoxy in the matter of sacrifices? Yet this is
perhaps the most crucial note of heresy which is recorded of the
Essenes. What was the law to the orthodox Pharisee without the
sacrifices, the temple-worship, the hierarchy? Yet the Essene
declined to take any part in the sacrifices; he had priests of his own
independently of the Levitical priesthood. On Frankel’s hypothesis
that Essenism is merely an exaggeration of pure Pharisaism, no explanation
of this abnormal phenomenon can be given. Frankel does
indeed attempt to meet the case by some speculations respecting the
red-heifer<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c016'><sup>[386]</sup></a>, which are so obviously inadequate that they have not
been repeated by later writers and may safely be passed over in
silence here. On this point indeed the language of Josephus is not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The notices of Josephus and Philo considered.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
quite explicit. He says (Ant. xviii. 1. 5) that, though they send
offerings (ἀναθῆματα) to the temple, they perform no sacrifices, and
he assigns as the reason their greater strictness as regards ceremonial
purity (διαφορότητι ἁγνειῶν ἃς νομίζοιεν), adding that ‘for this
reason being excluded from the common sanctuary (τεμενίσματος)
they perform their sacrifices by themselves (ἐφ’ αὑτῶν τὰς θυσίας
ἐπιτελοῦσι).’ Frankel therefore supposes that their only reason for
abstaining from the temple sacrifices was that according to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>severe notions the temple itself was profaned and therefore unfit for
sacrificial worship. But if so, why should it not vitiate the offerings,
as well as the sacrifices, and make them also unlawful? And indeed,
where Josephus is vague, Philo is explicit. Philo (II. p. 457) distinctly
states that the Essenes being more scrupulous than any in the
worship of God (ἐν τοῖς μάλιστα θεραπευταὶ θεοῦ) do not sacrifice animals
(οὐ ζῶα καταθύοντες), but hold it right to dedicate their own hearts
as a worthy offering (ἀλλ’ ἱεροπρεπεῖς τὰς ἑαυτῶν διανοίας κατασκευάζειν
ἀξιοῦντες). Thus the greater strictness, which Josephus ascribes to them,
consists in the abstention from shedding blood, as a pollution in
itself. And, when he speaks of their substituting private sacrifices,
his own qualifications show that he does not mean the word to be
taken literally. Their simple meals are their sacrifices; their refectory
is their sanctuary; their president is their priest<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c016'><sup>[387]</sup></a>. It should be
added also that, though we once hear of an Essene apparently within
the temple precincts (<cite>B.J.</cite>  i. 3. 5, <cite>Ant.</cite> xiii. <span class='fss'>II.</span> 2)<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c016'><sup>[388]</sup></a>, no mention is
ever made of one offering sacrifices. Thus it is clear that with the
Essene it was the sacrifices which polluted the temple, and not the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their statements confirmed by the doctrine of Christian Essenes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
temple which polluted the sacrifices. And this view is further recommended
by the fact that it alone will explain the position of
their descendants, the Christianized Essenes, who condemned the
slaughter of victims on grounds very different from those alleged
in the Epistle to the Hebrews, not because they have been superseded
by the Atonement, but because they are in their very nature
repulsive to God; not because they have ceased to be right, but
because they never were right from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be said indeed, that such a view could not be maintained
without impugning the authority, or at least disputing the
integrity, of the Old Testament writings. The sacrificial system is
so bound up with the Mosaic law, that it can only be rejected
by the most arbitrary excision. This violent process however,
uncritical as it is, was very likely to have been adopted by the
Essenes<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c016'><sup>[389]</sup></a>. As a matter of fact, it did recommend itself to those
Judaizing Christians who reproduced many of the Essene tenets, and
who both theologically and historically may be regarded as the lineal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Clementine Homilies justify this doctrine by arbitrary excision of the Scriptures.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
descendants of this Judaic sect<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c016'><sup>[390]</sup></a>. Thus in the <cite>Clementine Homilies</cite>,
an Ebionite work which exhibits many Essene features, the chief
spokesman St Peter is represented as laying great stress on the duty
of distinguishing the true and the false elements in the current
Scriptures (ii. 38, 51, iii. 4, 5, 10, 42, 47, 49, 50, comp. xviii. 19). The
saying traditionally ascribed to our Lord, ‘Show yourselves approved
money-changers’ (γίνεσθε τραπεζῖται δόκιμοι), is more than once quoted
by the Apostle as enforcing this duty (ii. 51, iii. 50, xviii. 20).
Among these false elements he places all those passages which represent
God as enjoining sacrifices (iii. 45, xviii. 19). It is plain, so he
argues, that God did not desire sacrifices, for did He not kill those
who lusted after the taste of flesh in the wilderness? and, if the
slaughter of animals was thus displeasing to Him, how could He
possibly have commanded victims to be offered to Himself (iii. 45)?
It is equally clear from other considerations that this was no part
of God’s genuine law. For instance, Christ declared that He came
to fulfil every tittle of the Law; yet Christ abolished sacrifices (iii.
51). And again, the saying ‘I will have mercy and not sacrifice’ is
a condemnation of this practice (iii. 56). The true prophet ‘hates
sacrifices, bloodshed, libations’; he ‘extinguishes the fire of altars’
(iii. 26). The frenzy of the lying soothsayer is a mere intoxication
produced by the reeking fumes of sacrifice (iii. 13). When in the
immediate context of these denunciations we find it reckoned among
the highest achievements of man ‘to know the <em>names of angels</em>, to
drive away demons, to endeavour to heal diseases by charms (φαρμακίαις),
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Essene features in this work.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and to find incantations (ἐπαοιδάς) against venomous serpents
(iii. 36)’;  when again St Peter is made to condemn as false
those scriptures which speak of God swearing, and to set against them
Christ’s command ‘Let your yea be  yea’ (iii. 55); we feel how
thoroughly this strange production of Ebionite Christianity is saturated
with Essene ideas<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c016'><sup>[391]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) The Essene worship of the Sun cannot be explained away.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>(ii) Nor again is Frankel successful in explaining the Essene
prayers to the sun by rabbinical practices<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c016'><sup>[392]</sup></a>. Following Rapoport,
he supposes that Josephus and Philo refer to the beautiful hymn
of praise for the creation of light and the return of day, which
forms part of the morning-prayer of the Jews to the present
time<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c016'><sup>[393]</sup></a>, and which seems to be enjoined in the Mishna itself<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c016'><sup>[394]</sup></a>; and
this view has been adopted by many subsequent writers. But the
language of Josephus is not satisfied by this explanation. For
he says plainly (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 5) that they addressed prayers to the
sun<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c016'><sup>[395]</sup></a>, and it is difficult to suppose that he has wantonly introduced
a dash of paganism into his picture; nor indeed was there
any adequate motive for his doing so. Similarly Philo relates of the
Therapeutes (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit. Cont.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II</span>, <span class='fss'>II</span>. p. 485), that they ‘stand with their
faces and their whole body towards the East, and when they see that
the sun is risen, holding out their hands to heaven they pray for
a happy day (εὐημερίαν) and for truth and for keen vision of reason
(ὀξυωπίαν λογισμοῦ).’ And here again it is impossible to overlook
the confirmation which these accounts receive from the history of
certain Christian heretics deriving their descent from this Judaic sect.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Sampsæans are an Essene sect,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Epiphanius (<cite>Hær.</cite> xix. 2, xx. 3, pp. 40 sq., 47) speaks of a sect
called the Sampsæans or ‘Sun-worshippers<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c016'><sup>[396]</sup></a>,’ as existing in his
own time in Peræa on the borders of Moab and on the shores of
the Dead Sea. He describes them as a remnant of the Ossenes
(i.e. Essenes), who have accepted a spurious form of Christianity
and are neither Jews nor Christians. This debased Christianity
which they adopted is embodied, he tells us, in the pretended
revelation of the Book of Elchasai, and dates from the time of
Trajan<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c016'><sup>[397]</sup></a>. Elsewhere (xxx. 3, p. 127) he seems to use the terms
Sampsæan, Ossene, and Elchasaite as synonymous (παρὰ τοῖς Σαμψηνοῖς
καὶ Ὀσσηνοῖς καὶ Ἐλκεσσαίοις καλουμένοις). Now we happen to
know something of this book of Elchasai, not only from Epiphanius
himself (xix. 1 sq., p. 40 sq., xxx. 17, p. 141), but also from Hippolytus
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>as appears from their sacred book of Elchesai.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(<cite>Hær.</cite> ix. 13 sq.) who describes it at considerable length. From
these accounts it appears that the principal feature in the book
was the injunction of frequent bathings for the remission of sins
(Hipp. <cite>Hær.</cite> ix. 13, 15 sq.). We are likewise told that it ‘anathematizes
immolations and sacrifices (θυσίας καὶ (ιερουργίας) as being alien
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to God and certainly not offered to God by tradition from (ἐκ) the
fathers and the law,’ while at the same time it ‘says that men ought
to pray there at Jerusalem, where the altar was and the sacrifices
(were offered), prohibiting the eating of flesh which exists among
the Jews, and the rest (of their customs), and the altar and the fire,
as being alien to God’ (Epiphan. xix. 3, p. 42). Notwithstanding,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its Essene peculiarities.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we are informed that the sect retained the rite of circumcision, the
observance of the sabbath, and other practices of the Mosaic law
(Hipp. <cite>Hær.</cite> ix. 14; Epiph. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hær.</cite></span> xix. 5, p. 43, comp. xxx. 17,
p. 141). This inconsistency is explained by a further notice in
Epiphanius (l.c.) that they treated the Scriptures in the same
way as the Nasaræans<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c016'><sup>[398]</sup></a>; that is, they submitted them to a process of
arbitrary excision, as recommended in the Clementine Homilies,
and thus rejected as falsifications all statements which did not square
with their own theory. Hippolytus also speaks of the Elchasaites
as studying astrology and magic, and as practising charms and
incantations on the sick and the demoniacs (§ 14). Moreover in two
formularies, one of expiation, another of purification, which this
father has extracted from the book, invocation is made to ‘the holy
spirits and the angels of prayer’ (§ 15, comp. Epiph. xix. 1). It
should be added that the word Elchasai probably signifies the ‘hidden
power’<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c016'><sup>[399]</sup></a>; while the book itself directed that its mysteries should be
guarded as precious pearls, and should not be communicated to the
world at large, but only to the faithful few (Hipp. ix. 15, 17). It is
hardly necessary to call attention to the number of Essene features
which are here combined<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c016'><sup>[400]</sup></a>. I would only remark that the value of
the notice is not at all diminished, but rather enhanced, by the uncritical
character of Epiphanius’ work; for this very fact prevents us
from ascribing the coincidences, which here reveal themselves, to this
father’s own invention.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Doubtful bearing of this Sun-worship.</div>

<p class='c000'>In this heresy we have plainly the dregs of Essenism, which
has only been corrupted from its earlier and nobler type by the
admixture of a spurious Christianity. But how came the Essenes
to be called Sampsæans? What was the original meaning of this
outward reverence which they paid to the sun? Did they regard it
merely as the symbol of Divine illumination, just as Philo frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>treats it as a type of God, the centre of all light (e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Somn.</cite></span>
i. 13 sq., I. p. 631 sq.), and even calls the heavenly bodies ‘visible
and sensible gods’ (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mund. Op.</cite></span> 7, I. p. 6)<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c016'><sup>[401]</sup></a>? Or did they honour
the light, as the pure ethereal element in contrast to gross terrestrial
matter, according to a suggestion of a recent writer<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c016'><sup>[402]</sup></a>? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The practice repugnant to Jewish orthodoxy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Whatever may
have been the motive of this reverence, it is strangely repugnant to
the spirit of orthodox Judaism. In Ezek. viii. 16 it is denounced as
an abomination, that men shall turn towards the east and worship
the sun; and accordingly in <cite>Berakhoth</cite> 7<em>a</em>, a saying of R. Meir is
reported to the effect that God is angry when the sun appears and the
kings of the East and the West prostrate themselves before this
luminary<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c016'><sup>[403]</sup></a>. We cannot fail therefore to recognise the action of some
foreign influence in this Essene practice—whether Greek or Syrian or
Persian, it will be time to consider hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iii) The depreciation of marriage not accounted for.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iii) On the subject of marriage again, talmudical and rabbinical
notices contribute nothing towards elucidating the practices of this
sect. Least of all do they point to any affinity between the Essenes
and the Pharisees. The nearest resemblance, which Frankel can
produce, to any approximation in this respect is an injunction in
Mishna <cite>Kethuboth</cite> v. 8 respecting the duties of the husband in providing
for the wife in case of his separating from her, and this he
ascribes to Essene influences<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c016'><sup>[404]</sup></a>; but this mishna does not express any
approval of such a separation. The direction seems to be framed
entirely in the interests of the wife: nor can I see that it is at all
inconsistent, as Frankel urges, with Mishna <cite>Kethuboth</cite> vii. 1 which
allows her to claim a divorce under such circumstances. But however
this may be, Essene and Pharisaic opinion stand generally in the
sharpest contrast to each other with respect to marriage. The talmudic
writings teem with passages implying not only the superior sanctity,
but even the imperative duty, of marriage. The words ‘Be fruitful
and multiply’ (Gen. i. 28) were regarded not merely as a promise,
but as a command, which was binding on all. It is a maxim of the
Talmud that ‘Any Jew who has not a wife is no man’ (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אינו אדם</span>,)
<cite>Yebamoth</cite> 63<em>a</em>. The fact indeed is so patent, that any accumulation
of examples would be superfluous, and I shall content myself
with referring to <cite>Pesachim</cite> 113<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, as fairly illustrating the doctrine
of orthodox Judaism on this point<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c016'><sup>[405]</sup></a>. As this question affects the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>whole framework not only of religious, but also of social life, the
antagonism between the Essene and the Pharisee in a matter so
vital could not be overlooked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iv) The Essene practice of magic still a difficulty.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iv) Nor again is it probable that the magical rites and incantations
which are so prominent in the practice of the Essenes would,
as a rule, have been received with any favour by the Pharisaic Jew.
In Mishna <cite>Pesachim</cite> iv. 9 (comp. <cite>Berakhoth</cite> 10<em>b</em>) it is mentioned
with approval that Hezekiah put away a ‘book of healings’; where
doubtless the author of the tradition had in view some volume of
charms ascribed to Solomon, like those which apparently formed part
of the esoteric literature of the Essenes<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c016'><sup>[406]</sup></a>. In the same spirit in Mishna
<cite>Sanhedrin</cite> xi. 1 R. Akiba shuts out from the hope of eternal life
any ‘who read profane or foreign (i.e. perhaps, apocryphal) books,
and who mutter over a wound’ the words of Exod. xv. 26. On
this point of difference however no great stress can be laid. Though
the nobler teachers among the orthodox Jews set themselves steadfastly
against the introduction of magic, they were unable to resist
the inpouring tide of superstition. In the middle of the second
century Justin Martyr alludes to exorcists and magicians among
the Jews, as though they were neither few nor obscure<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c016'><sup>[407]</sup></a>. Whether
these were a remnant of Essene Judaism, or whether such practices
had by this time spread throughout the whole body, it is impossible
to say; but the fact of their existence prevents us from founding
an argument on the use of magic, as an absolutely distinctive feature
of Essenism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General result.</div>

<p class='c000'>Other divergences also have been enumerated<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c016'><sup>[408]</sup></a>; but, as these do
not for the most part involve any great principles, and refer only to
practical details in which much fluctuation was possible, they cannot
under any circumstances be taken as crucial tests, and I have not
thought it worth while to discuss them. But the antagonisms on
which I have dwelt will tell their own tale. In three respects more
especially, in the avoidance of marriage, in the abstention from the
temple sacrifices, and (if the view which I have adopted be correct) in
the outward reverence paid to the sun, we have seen that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>an impassable gulf between the Essenes and the Pharisees. No
known influences within the sphere of Judaism proper will serve
to account for the position of the Essenes in these respects; and
we are obliged to look elsewhere for an explanation.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Frankel has failed in establishing his point.</div>

<p class='c000'>It was shown above that the investigations of Frankel and others
failed to discover in the talmudical writings a single reference to the
Essenes, which is at once direct and indisputable. It has now
appeared that they have also failed (and this is the really important
point) in showing that the ideas and practices generally considered
characteristic of the Essenes are recognised and incorporated in these
representative books of Jewish orthodoxy; and thus the hypothesis
that Essenism was merely a type, though an exaggerated type, of
pure Judaism falls to the ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Affinities between Essenes and Pharisees confined to the Judaic side.</div>

<p class='c000'>Some affinities indeed have been made out by Frankel and by
those who have anticipated or followed him. But these are exactly
such as we might have expected. Two distinct features combine to
make up the portrait of the Essene. The Judaic element is quite
as prominent in this sect as the non-Judaic. It could not be more
strongly emphasized than in the description given by Josephus himself.
In everything therefore which relates to the strictly Judaic
side of their tenets and practices, we should expect to discover not
only affinities, but even close affinities, in talmudic and rabbinic
authorities. And this is exactly what, as a matter of fact, we do
find. The Essene rules respecting the observance of the sabbath,
the rites of lustration, and the like, have often very exact parallels
in the writings of more orthodox Judaism. But I have not thought
it necessary to dwell on these coincidences, because they may well
be taken for granted and my immediate purpose did not require me to
emphasize them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The divergence of the Essenes from the Pharisees gradual.</div>

<p class='c000'>And again; it must be remembered that the separation between
Pharisee and Essene cannot always have been so great as it appears
in the Apostolic age. Both sects apparently arose out of one great
movement, of which the motive was the avoidance of pollution<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c016'><sup>[409]</sup></a>. The
divergence therefore must have been gradual. At the same time,
it does not seem a very profitable task to write a hypothetical history
of the growth of Essenism, where the data are wanting; and I shall
therefore abstain from the attempt. Frankel indeed has not been
deterred by this difficulty; but he has been obliged to assume his
data by postulating that such and such a person, of whom notices
are preserved, was an Essene, and thence inferring the character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of Essenism at the period in question from his recorded sayings or
doings. But without attempting any such reconstruction of history,
we may fairly allow that there must have been a gradual development;
and consequently in the earlier stages of its growth we should
not expect to find that sharp antagonism between the two sects, which
the principles of the Essenes when fully matured would involve.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hence the possibility of their appearing in the records of orthodox Judaism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If therefore it should be shown that the talmudical and rabbinical
writings here and there preserve with approval the sayings of certain
Essenes, this fact would present no difficulty. At present however no
decisive example has been produced; and the discoveries of Jellinek
for instance<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c016'><sup>[410]</sup></a>, who traces the influence of this sect in almost every
page of <cite>Pirke Aboth</cite>, can only be regarded as another illustration of
the extravagance with which the whole subject has been treated by
a large section of modern Jewish writers. More to the point is a
notice of an earlier Essene preserved in Josephus himself. We learn
from this historian that one Judas, a member of the sect, who had
prophesied the death of Antigonus, saw this prince ‘passing by through
the temple<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c016'><sup>[411]</sup></a>,’ when his prophecy was on the point of fulfilment
(about <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 110). At this moment Judas is represented as sitting
in the midst of his disciples, instructing them in the science of prediction.
The expression quoted would seem to imply that he was
actually teaching within the temple area. Thus he would appear
not only as mixing in the ordinary life of the Jews, but also as
frequenting the national sanctuary. But even supposing this to be
the right explanation of the passage, it will not present any serious
difficulty. Even at a later date, when (as we may suppose) the
principles of the sect had stiffened, the scruples of the Essene were
directed, if I have rightly interpreted the account of Josephus, rather
against the sacrifices than against the locality<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c016'><sup>[412]</sup></a>. The temple itself,
independently of its accompaniments, would not suggest any offence
to his conscience.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The approbation of Philo and Josephus is no evidence of orthodoxy.</div>

<p class='c000'>Nor again, is it any obstacle to the view which is here maintained,
that the Essenes are regarded with so much sympathy by Philo and
Josephus themselves. Even though the purity of Judaism might
have been somewhat sullied in this sect by the admixture of foreign
elements, this fact would attract rather than repel an eclectic like
Philo, and a latitudinarian like Josephus. The former, as an Alexandrian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>absorbed into his system many and diverse elements of heathen
philosophy, Platonic, Stoic, and Pythagorean. The latter, though
professedly a Pharisee, lost no opportunity of ingratiating himself
with his heathen conquerors, and would not be unwilling to gratify
their curiosity respecting a society with whose fame, as we infer
from the notice of Pliny, they were already acquainted.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>What was the foreign element in Essenism?</div>

<p class='c000'>But if Essenism owed the features which distinguished it from
Pharisaic Judaism to an alien admixture, whence were these foreign
influences derived? From the philosophers of Greece or from the
religious mystics of the East? On this point recent writers are
divided.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theory of Neopythagorean influence.</div>

<p class='c000'>Those who trace the distinctive characteristics of the sect to
Greece, regard it as an offshoot of the Neopythagorean School grafted
on the stem of Judaism. This solution is suggested by the statement
of Josephus, that ‘they practise the mode of life which among
the Greeks was introduced (καταδεδειγμένῃ) by Pythagoras<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c016'><sup>[413]</sup></a>.’ It
is thought to be confirmed by the strong resemblances which as a
matter of fact are found to exist between the institutions and practices
of the two.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Statement of the theory by Zeller.</div>

<p class='c000'>This theory, which is maintained also by other writers, as for
instance by Baur and Herzfeld, has found its ablest and most persistent
advocate in Zeller, who draws out the parallels with great
force and precision. ‘The Essenes,’ he writes, ‘like the Pythagoreans,
desire to attain a higher sanctity by an ascetic life; and the abstentions,
which they impose on themselves for this end, are the same
with both. They reject animal food and bloody sacrifices; they
avoid wine, warm baths, and oil for anointing; they set a high value
on celibate life: or, so far as they allow marriage, they require that
it be restricted to the one object of procreating children. Both wear
only white garments and consider linen purer than wool. Washings
and purifications are prescribed by both, though for the Essenes they
have a yet higher significance as religious acts. Both prohibit oaths
and (what is more) on the same grounds. Both find their social
ideal in those institutions, which indeed the Essenes alone set themselves
to realise—in a corporate life with entire community of goods,
in sharply defined orders of rank, in the unconditional submission
of all the members to their superiors, in a society carefully barred
from without, into which new members are received only after a
severe probation of several years, and from which the unworthy are
inexorably excluded. Both require a strict initiation, both desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Zeller’s theory.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to maintain a traditional doctrine inviolable; both pay the highest
respect to the men from whom it was derived, as instruments of
the deity: yet both also love figurative clothing for their doctrines,
and treat the old traditions as symbols of deeper truths, which they
must extract from them by means of allegorical explanation. In
order to prove the later form of teaching original, newly-composed
writings were unhesitatingly forged by the one as by the other,
and fathered upon illustrious names of the past. Both parties pay
honour to divine powers in the elements, both invoke the rising
sun, both seek to withdraw everything unclean from his sight, and
with this view give special directions, in which they agree as well
with each other as with older Greek superstition, in a remarkable
way. For both the belief in intermediate beings between God and
the world has an importance which is higher in proportion as their
own conception of God is purer; both appear not to have disdained
magic; yet both regard the gift of prophecy as the highest fruit of
wisdom and piety, which they pique themselves on possessing in
their most distinguished members. Finally, both agree (along with
the dualistic character of their whole conception of the world ...)
in their tenets respecting the origin of the soul, its relation to the
body, and the life after death<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c016'><sup>[414]</sup></a>....’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Absence of distinctive Pythagorean features in the Essenes.</div>

<p class='c000'>This array of coincidences is formidable, and thus skilfully
marshalled might appear at first sight invincible. But a closer
examination detracts from its value. In the first place the two
distinctive characteristics of the Pythagorean philosophy are wanting
to the Essenes. The Jewish sect did not believe in the transmigration
of souls; and the doctrine of numbers, at least so far as
our information goes, had no place in their system. Yet these constitute
the very essence of the Pythagorean teaching. In the next
place several of the coincidences are more apparent than real. Thus
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The coincidences are in some cases only apparent,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for instance the demons who in the Pythagorean system held an intermediate
place between the Supreme God and man, and were the
result of a compromise between polytheism and philosophy, have no
near relation to the angelology of the Essenes, which arose out of a
wholly different motive. Nor again can we find distinct traces among
the Pythagoreans of any such reverence for the sun as is ascribed to
the Essenes, the only notice which is adduced having no prominence
whatever in its own context, and referring to a rule which would
be dictated by natural decency and certainly was not peculiar to the
Pythagoreans<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c016'><sup>[415]</sup></a>. When these imperfect and (for the purpose) valueless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>resemblances have been subtracted, the only basis on which the
theory of a direct affiliation can rest is withdrawn. All the remaining
coincidences are unimportant. Thus the respect paid to
founders is not confined to any one sect or any one age. The
reverence of the Essenes for Moses, and the reverence of the
Pythagoreans for Pythagoras, are indications of a common humanity,
but not of a common philosophy. And again the forgery of supposititious
documents is unhappily not the badge of any one school.
The Solomonian books of the Essenes, so far as we can judge from
the extant notices, were about as unlike the tracts ascribed to
Pythagoras and his disciples by the Neopythagoreans as two such
forgeries could well be. All or nearly all that remains in common
to the Greek school and the Jewish sect after these deductions is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and in others do not suggest any historical connexion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a certain similarity in the type of life. But granted that two bodies
of men each held an esoteric teaching of their own, they would
secure it independently in a similar way, by a recognised process of
initiation, by a solemn form of oath, by a rigid distinction of orders.
Granted also, that they both maintained the excellence of an ascetic
life, their asceticism would naturally take the same form; they would
avoid wine and flesh; they would abstain from anointing themselves
with oil; they would depreciate, and perhaps altogether prohibit,
marriage. Unless therefore the historical conditions are themselves
favourable to a direct and immediate connexion between the Pythagoreans
and the Essenes, this theory of affiliation has little to
recommend it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Twofold objection to this theory.</div>

<p class='c000'>And a closer examination must pronounce them to be most
unfavourable. Chronology and geography alike present serious
obstacles to any solution which derives the peculiarities of the
Essenes from the Pythagoreans.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) Chronological facts are adverse.</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) The priority of time, if it can be pleaded on either side, must
be urged in favour of the Essenes. The Pythagoreans as a philosophical
school entirely disappear from history before the middle of
the fourth century before Christ. The last Pythagoreans were
scholars of Philolaus and Eurytus, the contemporaries of Socrates and
Plato<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c016'><sup>[416]</sup></a>. For nearly two centuries after their extinction we hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Disappearance of the Pythagoreans.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
nothing of them. Here and there persons like Diodorus of Aspendus
are satirised by the Attic poets of the middle comedy as ‘pythagorizers,’
in other words, as total abstainers and vegetarians<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c016'><sup>[417]</sup></a>; but
the philosophy had wholly died or was fast dying out. This is the
universal testimony of ancient writers. It is not till the first century
before Christ, that we meet with any distinct traces of a revival.
In Alexander Polyhistor<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c016'><sup>[418]</sup></a>, a younger contemporary of Sulla, for the
first time we find references to certain writings, which would seem
to have emanated from this incipient Neopythagoreanism, rather than
from the elder school of Pythagoreans. And a little later Cicero
commends his friend Nigidius Figulus as one specially raised up to
revive the extinct philosophy<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c016'><sup>[419]</sup></a>. But so slow or so chequered was
its progress, that a whole century after Seneca can still speak of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Priority of Essenism to Neopythagoreanism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
school as practically defunct<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c016'><sup>[420]</sup></a>. Yet long before this the Essenes
formed a compact, well-organized, numerous society with a peculiar
system of doctrine and a definite rule of life. We have seen that
Pliny the elder speaks of this celibate society as having existed
‘through thousands of ages<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c016'><sup>[421]</sup></a>.’ This is a gross exaggeration, but it
must at least be taken to imply that in Pliny’s time the origin of the
Essenes was lost in the obscurity of the past, or at least seemed so to
those who had not access to special sources of information. If, as
I have given reasons for supposing<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c016'><sup>[422]</sup></a>, Pliny’s authority in this passage
is the same Alexander Polyhistor to whom I have just referred,
and if this particular statement, however exaggerated in expression,
is derived from him, the fact becomes still more significant. But on
any showing the priority in time is distinctly in favour of the
Essenes as against the Neopythagoreans.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Essene tenets more developed than the Neopythagorean.</div>

<p class='c000'>And accordingly we find that what is only a tendency in the
Neopythagoreans is with the Essenes an avowed principle and a
definite rule of life. Such for instance is the case with celibacy, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>which Pliny says that it has existed as an institution among the
Essenes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per sæculorum millia</em></span>, and which is a chief corner-stone of
their practical system. The Pythagorean notices (whether truly or not,
it is unimportant for my purpose to enquire) speak of Pythagoras as
having a wife and a daughter<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c016'><sup>[423]</sup></a>. Only at a late date do we find the
attempt to represent their founder in another light; and if virginity is
ascribed to Apollonius of Tyana, the great Pythagorean of the first
Christian century, in the fictitious biography of Philostratus<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c016'><sup>[424]</sup></a>, this representation
is plainly due to the general plan of the novelist, whose
hero is intended to rival the Founder of Christianity, and whose work
is saturated with Christian ideas. In fact virginity can never be said
to have been a Pythagorean principle, though it may have been an
exalted ideal of some not very early adherents of the school. And
the same remark applies to other resemblances between the Essene
and Neopythagorean teaching. The clearness of conception and the
definiteness of practice are in almost every instance on the side of
the Essenes; so that, looking to the comparative chronology of the
two, it will appear almost inconceivable that they can have derived
their principles from the Neopythagoreans.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) Geographical difficulties in the theory.</div>

<p class='c000'>(ii) But the geographical difficulty also, which this theory of
affiliation involves, must be added to the chronological. The home
of the Essene sect is allowed on all hands to have been on the
eastern borders of Palestine, the shores of the Dead Sea, a region
least of all exposed to the influences of Greek philosophy. It is
true that we find near Alexandria a closely allied school of Jewish
recluses, the Therapeutes; and, as Alexandria may have been the
home of Neopythagoreanism, a possible link of connexion is here
disclosed. But, as Zeller himself has pointed out, it is not among
the Therapeutes, but among the Essenes, that the principles in
question appear fully developed and consistently carried out<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c016'><sup>[425]</sup></a>; and
therefore, if there be a relation of paternity between Essene and
Therapeute, the latter must be derived from the former and not
conversely. How then can we suppose this influence of Neopythagoreanism
brought to bear on a Jewish community in the south-eastern
border of Palestine? Zeller’s answer is as follows<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c016'><sup>[426]</sup></a>. Judæa
was for more than a hundred and fifty years before the Maccabean
period under the sovereignty first of the Egyptian and then of the
Syrian Greeks. We know that at this time Hellenizing influences
did infuse themselves largely into Judaism: and what more natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>than that among these the Pythagorean philosophy and discipline
should have recommended itself to a section of the Jewish people?
It may be said in reply, that at all events the special locality of the
Essenes is the least favourable to such a solution: but, without
pressing this fact, Zeller’s hypothesis is open to two serious objections
which combined seem fatal to it, unsupported as it is by any
historical notice. First, this influence of Pythagoreanism is assumed
to have taken place at the very time when the Pythagorean school
was practically extinct: and secondly, it is supposed to have acted
upon that very section of the Jewish community, which was the
most vigorous advocate of national exclusiveness and the most averse
to Hellenizing influences.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The foreign element of Essenism to be sought in the East,</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not therefore to Greek but to Oriental influences that considerations
of time and place, as well as of internal character, lead
us to look for an explanation of the alien elements in Essene Judaism.
And have we not here also the account of any real coincidences which
may exist between Essenism and Neopythagoreanism? We should
perhaps be hardly more justified in tracing Neopythagoreanism
directly to Essenism than conversely (though, if we had no other
alternative, this would appear to be the more probable solution
of the two): but were not both alike due to substantially the same
influences acting in different degrees? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>to which also Pythagoreanism may have been indebted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>I think it will hardly be denied
that the characteristic features of Pythagoreanism, and especially of
Neopythagoreanism, which distinguish it from other schools of Greek
philosophy, are much more Oriental in type, than Hellenic. The
asceticism, the magic, the mysticism, of the sect all point in the
same direction. And history moreover contains indications that
such was the case. There seems to be sufficient ground for the
statement that Pythagoras himself was indebted to intercourse with
the Egyptians, if not with more strictly Oriental nations, for some
leading ideas of his system. But, however this may be, the fact
that in the legendary accounts, which the Neopythagoreans invented
to do honour to the founder of the school, he is represented as taking
lessons from the Chaldeans, Persians, Brahmins, and others, may be
taken as an evidence that their own philosophy at all events was
partially derived from eastern sources<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c016'><sup>[427]</sup></a>.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>But, if the alien elements of Essenism were borrowed not so
much from Greek philosophy as from Oriental mysticism, to what
nation or what religion was it chiefly indebted? To this question it
is difficult, with our very imperfect knowledge of the East at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Christian era, to reply with any confidence. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Resemblances to Parsism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Yet there is one system
to which we naturally look, as furnishing the most probable answer.
The Medo-Persian religion supplies just those elements which distinguish
the tenets and practices of the Essenes from the normal
type of Judaism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(i) Dualism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(1) First; we have here a very definite form of
dualism, which exercised the greatest influence on subsequent Gnostic
sects, and of which Manicheism, the most mature development of
dualistic doctrine in connexion with Christianity, was the ultimate
fruit. For though dualism may not represent the oldest theology
of the Zend-Avesta in its unadulterated form, yet long before the
era of which we are speaking it had become the fundamental principle
of the Persian religion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(ii) Sun-worship.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(2) Again; the Zoroastrian symbolism
of light, and consequent worship of the sun as the fountain of light,
will explain those anomalous notices of the Essenes in which they are
represented as paying reverence to this luminary<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c016'><sup>[428]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(iii) Angelolatry.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(3) Moreover;
the ‘worship of angels’ in the Essene system has a striking parallel
in the invocations of spirits, which form a very prominent feature
in the ritual of the Zend-Avesta. And altogether their angelology
is illustrated, and not improbably was suggested, by the doctrine of
intermediate beings concerned in the government of nature and of
man, such as the Amshaspands, which is an integral part of the
Zoroastrian system<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c016'><sup>[429]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(iv) Magic.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(4) And once more; the magic, which was so
attractive to the Essene, may have received its impulse from the
priestly caste of Persia, to whose world-wide fame this form of superstition
is indebted for its name. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(v) Striving after purity.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(5) If to these parallels I venture
also to add the intense striving after purity, which is the noblest
feature in the Persian religion, I do so, not because the Essenes
might not have derived this impulse from a higher source, but
because this feature was very likely to recommend the Zoroastrian
system to their favourable notice, and because also the particular
form which the zeal for purity took among them was at all events
congenial to the teaching of the Zend-Avesta, and may not have
been altogether free from its influences.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other coincidences accidental.</div>

<p class='c000'>I have preferred dwelling on these broader resemblances, because
they are much more significant than any mere coincidence of details,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>which may or may not have been accidental. Thus for instance the
magi, like the Essenes, wore white garments, and eschewed gold
and ornaments; they practised frequent lustrations; they avoided
flesh, living on bread and cheese or on herbs and fruits; they
had different orders in their society; and the like<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c016'><sup>[430]</sup></a>. All these, as I
have already remarked, may be the independent out-growth of the
same temper and direction of conduct, and need not imply any direct
historical connexion. Nor is there any temptation to press such
resemblances; for even without their aid the general connexion seems
to be sufficiently established<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c016'><sup>[431]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The destruction of the Persian empire not adverse</div>

<p class='c000'>But it is said, that the history of Persia does not favour the
hypothesis of such an influence as is here assumed. The destruction
of the Persian empire by Alexander, argues Zeller<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c016'><sup>[432]</sup></a>, and the subsequent
erection of the Parthian domination on its ruins, must have
been fatal to the spread of Zoroastrianism. From the middle of the
third century before Christ, when the Parthian empire was established,
till towards the middle of the third century of our era,
when the Persian monarchy and religion were once more restored<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c016'><sup>[433]</sup></a>,
its influence must have been reduced within the narrowest limits.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>but favourable to the spread of Parsism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But does analogy really suggest such an inference? Does not the
history of the Jews themselves show that the religious influence of
a people on the world at large may begin just where its national
life ends? The very dispersion of Zoroastrianism, consequent on the
fall of the empire, would impregnate the atmosphere far and wide;
and the germs of new religious developments would thus be implanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in alien soils. For in tracing Essenism to Persian influences I have
not wished to imply that this Jewish sect consciously incorporated
the Zoroastrian philosophy and religion as such, but only that
Zoroastrian ideas were infused into its system by more or less direct
contact. And, as a matter of fact, it seems quite certain that Persian
ideas were widely spread during this very interval, when the Persian
nationality was eclipsed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Indications of its influence during this period.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>It was then that Hermippus gave to the
Greeks the most detailed account of this religion which had ever been
laid before them<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c016'><sup>[434]</sup></a>. It was then that its tenets suggested or moulded
the speculations of the various Gnostic sects. It was then that
the worship of the Persian Mithras spread throughout the Roman
Empire. It was then, if not earlier, that the magian system took
root in Asia Minor, making for itself (as it were) a second home in
Cappadocia<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c016'><sup>[435]</sup></a>. It was then, if not earlier, that the Zoroastrian demonology
stamped itself so deeply on the apocryphal literature of the
Jews themselves, which borrowed even the names of evil spirits<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c016'><sup>[436]</sup></a>
from the Persians. There are indeed abundant indications that
Palestine was surrounded by Persian influences during this period,
when the Persian empire was in abeyance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus we seem to have ample ground for the view that certain
alien features in Essene Judaism were derived from the Zoroastrian
religion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Are Buddhist influences also perceptible?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But are we justified in going a step further, and attributing
other elements in this eclectic system to the more distant East?
The monasticism of the Buddhist will naturally occur to our
minds, as a precursor of the cenobitic life among the Essenes; and
Hilgenfeld accordingly has not hesitated to ascribe this characteristic
of Essenism directly to Buddhist influences<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c016'><sup>[437]</sup></a>. But at the outset
we are obliged to ask whether history gives any such indication
of the presence of Buddhism in the West as this hypothesis requires.
Hilgenfeld answers this question in the affirmative. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Supposed Buddhist establishment at Alexandria.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>He points
triumphantly to the fact that as early as the middle of the second
century before Christ the Buddhist records speak of their faith as
flourishing in Alasanda the chief city of the land of Yavana. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>place intended, he conceives, can be none other than the great
Alexandria, the most famous of the many places bearing the name<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c016'><sup>[438]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The authority misinterpreted<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In this opinion however he stands quite alone. Neither Köppen<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c016'><sup>[439]</sup></a>,
who is his authority for this statement, nor any other Indian
scholar<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c016'><sup>[440]</sup></a>, so far as I am aware, for a moment contemplates this identification.
Yavana, or Yona, was the common Indian name for the
Græco-Bactrian kingdom and its dependencies<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c016'><sup>[441]</sup></a>; and to this region
we naturally turn. The Alasanda or Alasadda therefore, which is
here mentioned, will be one of several Eastern cities bearing the name
of the great conqueror, most probably <em>Alexandria ad Caucasum</em>.
But indeed I hardly think that, if Hilgenfeld had referred to the
original authority for the statement, the great Buddhist history
<cite>Mahawanso</cite>, he would have ventured to lay any stress at all on
this notice, as supporting his theory. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and wholly untrustworthy in itself.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The historian, or rather
fabulist (for such he is in this earlier part of his chronicle), is relating
the foundation of the Mahá thúpo, or great tope, at Ruanwelli
by the king Dutthagámini in the year <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 157. Beyond the fact
that this tope was erected by this king the rest is plainly legendary.
All the materials for the construction of the building, we are told,
appeared spontaneously as by miracle—the bricks, the metals, the
precious stones. The dewos, or demons, lent their aid in the erection.
In fact</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Priests gathered in enormous numbers from all the great Buddhist
monasteries to do honour to the festival of the foundation. One
place alone sent not less than 96,000. Among the rest it is mentioned
that ‘Maha Dhammarakkito, théro (<em>i.e.</em> senior priest) of Yóna, accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>by 30,000 priests from the vicinity of Alasaddá, the capital
of the Yóna country, attended<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c016'><sup>[442]</sup></a>.’ It is obvious that no weight can
be attached to a statement occurring as part of a story of which
the other details are so manifestly false. An establishment of
30,000 Buddhist priests at Alexandria would indeed be a phenomenon
of which historians have shown a strange neglect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General ignorance of Buddhism in the West.</div>

<p class='c000'>Nor is the presence of any Buddhist establishment even on a
much smaller scale in this important centre of western civilization
at all reconcilable with the ignorance of this religion, which the
Greeks and Romans betray at a much later date<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c016'><sup>[443]</sup></a>. For some centuries

is apparently no notice in either heathen or Christian writers, which
points to the presence of a Buddhist within the limits of the Roman
Empire, till long after the Essenes had ceased to exist<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c016'><sup>[451]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The alleged coincidences prove nothing.</div>

<p class='c000'>And, if so, the coincidences must be very precise, before we are
justified in attributing any peculiarities of Essenism to Buddhist
influences. This however is far from being the case. They both
exhibit a well-organized monastic society: but the monasticism
of the Buddhist priests, with its systematized mendicancy, has little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Monasticism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in common with the monasticism of the Essene recluse, whose life
was largely spent in manual labour. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Asceticism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>They both enjoin celibacy,
both prohibit the use of flesh and of wine, both abstain from the
slaughter of animals. But, as we have already seen, such resemblances
prove nothing, for they may be explained by the independent
development of the same religious principles. One coincidence,
and one only, is noticed by Hilgenfeld, which at first sight seems
more striking and might suggest a historical connexion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Four orders and four steps.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>He observes
that the four orders of the Essene community are derived from the
four steps of Buddhism. Against this it might fairly be argued
that such coincidences of numbers are often purely accidental,
and that in the present instance there is no more reason for connecting
the four steps of Buddhism with the four orders of Essenism
than there would be for connecting the ten precepts of Buddha
with the Ten Commandments of Moses. But indeed a nearer
examination will show that the two have nothing whatever in
common except the number. The four steps or paths of Buddhism
are not four grades of an external order, but four degrees of spiritual
progress on the way to nirvana or annihilation, the ultimate goal
of the Buddhist’s religious aspirations. They are wholly unconnected
with the Buddhist monastic system, as an organization.
A reference to the Buddhist notices collected in Hardy’s <cite>Eastern
Monachism</cite> (p. 280 sq.) will at once dispel any suspicion of a
resemblance. A man may attain to the highest of these four stages
of Buddhist illumination instantaneously. He does not need to
have passed through the lower grades, but may even be a layman
at the time. Some merit obtained in a previous state of existence
may raise him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>per saltum</em></span> to the elevation of a rahat, when all
earthly desires are crushed and no future birth stands between him
and nirvana. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Buddhist influences seen first in Manicheism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>There remains therefore no coincidence which would
suggest any historical connexion between Essenism and Buddhism.
Indeed it is not till some centuries later, when Manicheism starts
into being, that we find for the first time any traces of the influence
of Buddhism on the religions of the West<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c016'><sup>[452]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>3. <br /> ESSENISM AND CHRISTIANITY.</h3>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c015'>The theory which explains Christianity as an outgrowth of Essenism,</div>

<p class='c000'>It has become a common practice with a certain class of writers to
call Essenism to their aid in accounting for any distinctive features
of Christianity, which they are unable to explain in any other
way. Wherever some external power is needed to solve a perplexity,
here is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>deus ex machina</em></span> whose aid they most readily invoke.
Constant repetition is sure to produce its effect, and probably not a
few persons, who want either the leisure or the opportunity to
investigate the subject for themselves, have a lurking suspicion
that the Founder of Christianity may have been an Essene, or at
all events that Christianity was largely indebted to Essenism for its
doctrinal and ethical teaching<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c016'><sup>[453]</sup></a>. Indeed, when very confident and
sweeping assertions are made, it is natural to presume that they
rest on a substantial basis of fact. Thus for instance we are told by
one writer that Christianity is ‘Essenism alloyed with foreign elements’<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c016'><sup>[454]</sup></a>:
while another, who however approaches the subject in a
different spirit, says; ‘It will hardly be doubted that our Saviour
Himself belonged to this holy brotherhood. This will especially be
apparent, when we remember that <em>the whole Jewish community</em> at
the advent of Christ was divided into three parties, the Pharisees,
the Sadducees, and the Essenes, and that <em>every Jew had to belong to
one of these sects</em>. Jesus who in all things conformed to the Jewish
law, and who was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners, would therefore naturally associate Himself with that order
of Judaism which was most congenial to his nature’.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c016'><sup>[455]</sup></a><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>tested by facts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>I purpose
testing these strong assertions by an appeal to facts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Our Lord need not have belonged to any sect.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>For the statements involved in those words of the last extract
which I have underlined, no authority is given by the writer himself;
nor have I been able to find confirmation of them in any
quarter. On the contrary the frequent allusions which we find to
the vulgar herd, the ιδιῶται, the <em>عam haarets</em>, who are distinguished
from the disciples of the schools<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c016'><sup>[456]</sup></a>, suggest that a large proportion of
the people was unattached to any sect. If it had been otherwise, we
might reasonably presume that our Lord, as one who ‘in all things
conformed to the Jewish law,’ would have preferred attaching Himself
to the Pharisees who ‘sat in Moses’ seat’ and whose precepts
He recommended His disciples to obey<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c016'><sup>[457]</sup></a>, rather than to the Essenes
who in one important respect at least—the repudiation of the temple
sacrifices—acted in flagrant violation of the Mosaic ordinances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The argument from the silence of the New Testament answered.</div>

<p class='c000'>This preliminary barrier being removed, we are free to investigate
the evidence for their presumed connexion. And here we are
met first with a negative argument, which obviously has great
weight with many persons. Why, it is asked, does Jesus, who so
unsparingly denounces the vices and the falsehoods of Pharisees and
Sadducees, never once mention the Essenes by way of condemnation,
or indeed mention them by name at all? Why, except that He
himself belonged to this sect and looked favourably on their
teaching? This question is best answered by another. How can
we explain the fact, that throughout the enormous mass of talmudical
and early rabbinical literature this sect is not once mentioned
by name, and that even the supposed allusions to them, which
have been discovered for the first time in the present century, turn
out on investigation to be hypothetical and illusory? The difficulty
is much greater in this latter instance; but the answer is the same
in both cases. The silence is explained by the comparative insignificance
of the sect, their small numbers and their retired habits.
Their settlements were far removed from the great centres of political
and religious life. Their recluse habits, as a rule, prevented them
from interfering in the common business of the world. Philo and
Josephus have given prominence to them, because their ascetic
practices invested them with the character of philosophers and
interested the Greeks and Romans in their history; but in the
national life of the Jews they bore a very insignificant part<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c016'><sup>[458]</sup></a>. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Sadducees, who held the highest offices in the hierarchy, are only
mentioned directly on three occasions in the Gospels<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c016'><sup>[459]</sup></a>, it can be no
surprise that the Essenes are not named at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The positive arguments for a connexion may be twofold.</div>

<p class='c000'>As no stress therefore can be laid on the argument for silence,
any hypothesis of connexion between Essenism and Christianity
must make good its claims by establishing one or both of these two
points: <em>first</em>, that there is direct historical evidence of close intercourse
between the two; and <em>secondly</em>, that the resemblances of
doctrine and practice are so striking as to oblige, or at least to
warrant, the belief in such a connexion. If both these lines of
argument fail, the case must be considered to have broken down.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. Absence of direct historical evidence of a connexion.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. On the former point it must be premised that the Gospel
narrative does not suggest any hint of a connexion. Indeed its general
tenor is directly adverse to such a supposition. From first to last
Jesus and his disciples move about freely, taking part in the
common business, even in the common recreations, of Jewish life.
The recluse ascetic brotherhood, which was gathered about the shores
of the Dead Sea, does not once appear above the Evangelists’ horizon.
Of this close society, as such, there is not the faintest indication.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two individual cases alleged.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But two individuals have been singled out, as holding an important
place either in the Evangelical narrative or in the Apostolic Church,
who, it is contended, form direct and personal links of communication
with this sect. These are John the Baptist and James the
Lord’s brother. The one is the forerunner of the Gospel, the first
herald of the Kingdom; the other is the most prominent figure in the
early Church of Jerusalem.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) John the Baptist</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) John the Baptist was an ascetic. His abode was the desert;
his clothing was rough; his food was spare; he baptized his
penitents. Therefore, it is argued, he was an Essene. Between the
premisses and the conclusion however there is a broad gulf, which cannot
very easily be bridged over. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>not an Essene.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The solitary independent life, which
John led, presents a type wholly different from the cenobitic establishments
of the Essenes, who had common property, common
meals, common hours of labour and of prayer. It may even be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>questioned whether his food of locusts would have been permitted
by the Essenes, if they really ate nothing which had life (ἔμψυχον<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c016'><sup>[460]</sup></a>).
And again; his baptism as narrated by the Evangelists, and their
lustrations as described in Josephus, have nothing in common except
the use of water for a religious purpose. When therefore we are
told confidently that ‘his manner of life was altogether after the
Essene pattern<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c016'><sup>[461]</sup></a>,’ and that ‘he without doubt baptized his converts
into the Essene order,’ we know what value to attach to this bold
assertion. If positive statements are allowable, it would be more
true to fact to say that he could not possibly have been an Essene.
The rule of his life was <em>isolation</em>; the principle of theirs, <em>community</em><a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c016'><sup>[462]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>External resemblances to John in Banus,</div>

<p class='c000'>In this mode of life John was not singular. It would appear
that not a few devout Jews at this time retired from the world and
buried themselves in the wilderness, that they might devote themselves
unmolested to ascetic discipline and religious meditation.
One such instance at all events we have in Banus the master of
Josephus, with whom the Jewish historian, when a youth, spent
three years in the desert. This anchorite was clothed in garments
made of bark or of leaves; his food was the natural produce of the
earth; he bathed day and night in cold water for purposes of
purification. To the careless observer doubtless John and Banus
would appear to be men of the same stamp. In their outward mode
of life there was perhaps not very much difference<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c016'><sup>[463]</sup></a>. The consciousness
of a divine mission, the gift of a prophetic insight, in John was
the real and all-important distinction between the two. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>who was not an Essene.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But here
also the same mistake is made; and we not uncommonly find Banus
described as an Essene. It is not too much to say however, that the
whole tenor of Josephus’ narrative is opposed to this supposition<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c016'><sup>[464]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>He says that when sixteen years old he desired to acquire a knowledge
of the three sects of the Jews before making his choice of one;
that accordingly he went through (διῆλθον) all the three at the cost
of much rough discipline and toil; that he was not satisfied with the
experience thus gained, and hearing of this Banus he attached
himself to him as his zealous disciple (ζηλωτὴς ἐγενόμην αὐτοῦ); that
having remained three years with him he returned to Jerusalem;
and that then, being nineteen years old, he gave in his adhesion to
the sect of the Pharisees. Thus there is no more reason for connecting
this Banus with the Essenes than with the Pharisees. The
only natural interpretation of the narrative is that he did not belong
to any of the three sects, but represented a distinct type of religious
life, of which Josephus was anxious to gain experience. And his
hermit life seems to demand this solution, which the sequence of the
narrative suggests.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General result.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of John himself therefore no traits are handed down which
suggest that he was a member of the Essene community. He was an
ascetic, and the Essenes were ascetics; but this is plainly an inadequate
basis for any such inference. Nor indeed is the relation of his
asceticism to theirs a question of much moment for the matter in
hand; since this was the very point in which Christ’s mode of life
was so essentially different from John’s as to provoke criticism
and to point a contrast<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c016'><sup>[465]</sup></a>. But the later history of his real or supposed
disciples has, or may seem to have, some bearing on this
investigation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Hemerobaptists.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Towards the close of the first and the beginning
of the second century we meet with a body of sectarians called
in Greek <em>Hemerobaptists</em><a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c016'><sup>[466]</sup></a>, in Hebrew <em>Toble-shacharith</em><a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c016'><sup>[467]</sup></a>, ‘day’ or
‘morning bathers.’ What were their relations to John the Baptist
on the one hand, and to the Essenes on the other? Owing to
the scantiness of our information the whole subject is wrapped in
obscurity, and any restoration of their history must be more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>less hypothetical; but it will be possible at all events to suggest
an account which is not improbable in itself, and which does no
violence to the extant notices of the sect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(<em>a</em>) Their relation to John the Baptist.</div>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) We must not hastily conclude, when we meet with certain
persons at Ephesus about the years <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 53, 54, who are described
as ‘knowing only the baptism of John,’ or as having been ‘baptized
unto John’s baptism<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c016'><sup>[468]</sup></a>,’ that we have here some early representatives
of the Hemerobaptist sect. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>John’s disciples at Ephesus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>These were Christians, though imperfectly
informed Christians. Of Apollos, who was more fully instructed by
Aquila and Priscilla, this is stated in the most explicit terms<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c016'><sup>[469]</sup></a>. Of
the rest, who owed their fuller knowledge of the Gospel to St Paul,
the same appears to be implied, though the language is not free from
ambiguity<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c016'><sup>[470]</sup></a>. But these notices have an important bearing on our
subject; for they show how profoundly the effect of John’s preaching
was felt in districts as remote as proconsular Asia, even after a lapse
of a quarter of a century. With these disciples it was the initial
impulse towards Christianity; but to others it represented a widely
different form of belief and practice. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Professed followers at a later date.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The Gospel of St John was
written, according to all tradition, at Ephesus in the later years of
the first century. Again and again the Evangelist impresses on his
readers, either directly by his own comments or indirectly by the
course of the narrative, the transient and subordinate character of
John’s ministry. He was not the light, says the Evangelist, but
came to bear witness of the light<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c016'><sup>[471]</sup></a>. He was not the sun in the
heavens: he was only the waning lamp, which shines when kindled
from without and burns itself away in shining. His light might well
gladden the Jews while it lasted, but this was only ‘for a season<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c016'><sup>[472]</sup></a>.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>John himself lost no opportunity of bearing his testimony to the
loftier claims of Jesus<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c016'><sup>[473]</sup></a>. From such notices it is plain that in the
interval between the preaching of St Paul and the Gospel of St
John the memory of the Baptist at Ephesus had assumed a new
attitude towards Christianity. His name is no longer the sign of
imperfect appreciation, but the watchword of direct antagonism.
John had been set up as a rival Messiah to Jesus. In other
words, this Gospel indicates the spread of Hemerobaptist principles,
if not the presence of a Hemerobaptist community, in proconsular
Asia, when it was written. In two respects these Hemerobaptists
distorted the facts of history. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The facts of history distorted by them.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>They perverted John’s teaching, and
they misrepresented his office. His baptism was no more a single
rite, once performed and initiating an amendment of life; it was a
daily recurrence atoning for sin and sanctifying the person<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c016'><sup>[474]</sup></a>. He
himself was no longer the forerunner of the Messiah; he was the
very Messiah<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c016'><sup>[475]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Spread of Hemerobaptist principles.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In the latter half of the first century, it would
seem, there was a great movement among large numbers of the
Jews in favour of frequent baptism, as the one purificatory rite
essential to salvation. Of this superstition we have had an instance
already in the anchorite Banus to whom Josephus attached himself
as a disciple. Its presence in the western districts of Asia Minor
is shown by a Sibylline poem, dating about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 80, which I have
already had occasion to quote<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c016'><sup>[476]</sup></a>. Some years earlier these sectarians
are mentioned by name as opposing James the Lord’s brother and
the Twelve at Jerusalem<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c016'><sup>[477]</sup></a>. Nor is there any reason for questioning
their existence as a sect in Palestine during the later years of the
Apostolic age, though the source from which our information comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>is legendary, and the story itself a fabrication. But when or how
they first connected themselves with the name of John the Baptist,
and whether this assumption was made by all alike or only by one
section of them, we do not know. Such a connexion, however false
to history, was obvious and natural; nor would it be difficult to
accumulate parallels to this false appropriation of an honoured name.
Baptism was the fundamental article of their creed; and John was
the Baptist of world-wide fame. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A wrong use made of John’s name.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Nothing more than this was
needed for the choice of an eponym. From St John’s Gospel
it seems clear that this appropriation was already contemplated,
if not completed, at Ephesus before the first century had drawn
to a close. In the second century the assumption is recognised
as a characteristic of these Hemerobaptists, or Baptists, as they are
once called<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c016'><sup>[478]</sup></a>, alike by those who allow and those who deny its
justice<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c016'><sup>[479]</sup></a>. Even in our age the name of ‘John’s disciples’ has been
given, though wrongly given, to an obscure sect in Babylonia, the
Mandeans, whose doctrine and practice have some affinities to the
older sect, and of whom perhaps they are the collateral, if not the
direct, descendants<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c016'><sup>[480]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(<em>b</em>) Their relation to the Essenes.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>(<em>b</em>) Of the connexion between this sect and John the Baptist
we have been able to give a probable, though necessarily hypothetical
account. But when we attempt to determine its relation to
the Essenes, we find ourselves entangled in a hopeless mesh of
perplexities. The notices are so confused, the affinities so subtle,
the ramifications so numerous, that it becomes a desperate task to
distinguish and classify these abnormal Jewish and Judaizing heresies.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>They were at first distinct, if not antagonistic.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
One fact however seems clear that, whatever affinities they may have
had originally, and whatever relations they may have contracted
afterwards with one another, the Hemerobaptists, properly speaking,
were not Essenes. The Sibylline poem which may be regarded as
in some respects a Hemerobaptist manifesto contains, as we saw,
many traits inconsistent with pure Essenism<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c016'><sup>[481]</sup></a>. In two several accounts,
the memoirs of Hegesippus and the Apostolic Constitutions, the
Hemerobaptists are expressly distinguished from the Essenes<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c016'><sup>[482]</sup></a>. In an
early production of Judaic Christianity, whose Judaism has a strong
Essene tinge, the Clementine Homilies, they and their eponym are
condemned in the strongest language. The system of syzygies, or
pairs of opposites, is a favourite doctrine of this work, and in these
John stands contrasted to Jesus, as Simon Magus to Simon Peter, as
the false to the true; for according to this author’s philosophy
of history the manifestation of the false always precedes the manifestation
of the true<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c016'><sup>[483]</sup></a>. And again, Epiphanius speaks of them as
agreeing substantially in their doctrines, not with the Essenes, but
with the Scribes and Pharisees<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c016'><sup>[484]</sup></a>. His authority on such a point
may be worth very little; but connected with other notices, it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>not be passed over in silence. Yet, whatever may have been their
differences, the Hemerobaptists and the Essenes had one point of
direct contact, their belief in the moral efficacy of lustrations. When
the temple and polity were destroyed, the shock vibrated through
the whole fabric of Judaism, loosening and breaking up existing
societies, and preparing the way for new combinations. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>But after the destruction of the Temple<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>More especially
the cessation of the sacrificial rites must have produced
a profound effect equally on those who, like the Essenes, had condemned
them already, and on those who, as possibly was the case
with the Hemerobaptists, had hitherto remained true to the orthodox
ritual. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>there may have been a fusion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>One grave obstacle to friendly overtures was thus removed;
and a fusion, more or less complete, may have been the consequence.
At all events the relations of the Jewish sects must have been
materially affected by this great national crisis, as indeed we know to
have been the case. In the confusion which follows, it is impossible
to attain any clear view of their history. At the beginning of the
second century however this pseudo-baptist movement received a fresh
impulse from the pretended revelation of Elchesai, which came from
the farther East<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c016'><sup>[485]</sup></a>. Henceforth Elchesai is the prominent name in
the history of those Jewish and Judaizing sects whose proper home
is east of the Jordan<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c016'><sup>[486]</sup></a>, and who appear to have reproduced, with
various modifications derived from Christian and Heathen sources,
the Gnostic theology and the pseudo-baptist ritual of their Essene
predecessors. It is still preserved in the records of the only extant
people who have any claim to be regarded as the religious heirs of
the Essenes. Elchesai is regarded as the founder of the sect of
Mandeans<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c016'><sup>[487]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) James the Lord’s Brother</div>

<p class='c000'>(ii) But, if great weight has been attached to the supposed
connexion of John the Baptist with the Essenes, the case of James the
Lord’s brother has been alleged with still more confidence. Here,
it is said, we have an indisputable Essene connected by the closest
family ties with the Founder of Christianity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>invested with Essene characteristics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>James is reported to

head, no oil to anoint his body; to have abstained from using the
bath; and lastly to have worn no wool, but only fine linen<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c016'><sup>[488]</sup></a>. Here
we have a description of Nazarite practices at least and (must it not
be granted) of Essene tendencies also.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what is our authority for this description? The writer, from
whom the account is immediately taken, is the Jewish-Christian historian
Hegesippus, who flourished about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 170. He cannot therefore
have been an eye-witness of the facts which he relates. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>But the account comes from untrustworthy sources.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>And
his whole narrative betrays its legendary character. Thus his account
of James’s death, which follows immediately on this description, is
highly improbable and melodramatic in itself, and directly contradicts
the contemporary notice of Josephus in its main facts<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c016'><sup>[489]</sup></a>.
From whatever source therefore Hegesippus may have derived his
information, it is wholly untrustworthy. Nor can we doubt that he
was indebted to one of those romances with which the Judaizing
Christians of Essene tendencies loved to gratify the natural curiosity of
their disciples respecting the first founders of the Church<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c016'><sup>[490]</sup></a>. In like
manner Essene portraits are elsewhere preserved of the Apostles Peter<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c016'><sup>[491]</sup></a>
and Matthew<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c016'><sup>[492]</sup></a>, which represent them as living on a spare diet of
herbs and berries. I believe also that I have elsewhere pointed out
the true source of this description in Hegesippus, and that it is taken
from the ‘Ascents of James<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c016'><sup>[493]</sup></a>,’ a Judæo-Christian work stamped,
as we happen to know, with the most distinctive Essene features<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c016'><sup>[494]</sup></a>.
But if we turn from these religious novels of Judaic Christianity
to earlier and more trustworthy sources of information—to the
Gospels or the Acts or the Epistles of St Paul—we fail to discover
the faintest traces of Essenism in James. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>No Essene features in the true portraits of James or of the earliest disciples.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>‘The historical James,’
says a recent writer, ‘shows Pharisaic but not Essene sympathies<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a>.’
This is true of James, as it is true of the early disciples in the mother
Church of Jerusalem generally. The temple-ritual, the daily-sacrifices,
suggested no scruples to them. The only distinction of meats, which
they recognised, was the distinction of animals clean and unclean as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>laid down by the Mosaic law. The only sacrificial victims, which
they abhorred, were victims offered to idols. They took their part in
the religious offices, and mixed freely in the common life, of their
fellow-Israelites, distinguished from them only in this, that to their
Hebrew inheritance they superadded the knowledge of a higher truth
and the joy of a better hope. It was altogether within the sphere
of orthodox Judaism that the Jewish element in the Christian
brotherhood found its scope. Essene peculiarities are the objects
neither of sympathy nor of antipathy. In the history of the infant
Church for the first quarter of a century Essenism is as though it
were not.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Essene influences visible before the close of the Apostolic age.</div>

<p class='c000'>But a time came, when all this was changed. Even as early as the
year 58, when St Paul wrote to the Romans, we detect practices in the
Christian community of the metropolis, which may possibly have been
due to Essene influences<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c016'><sup>[496]</sup></a>. Five or six years later, the heretical
teaching which threatened the integrity of the Gospel at Colossæ
shows that this type of Judaism was already strong enough within
the Church to exert a dangerous influence on its doctrinal purity.
Then came the great convulsion—the overthrow of the Jewish polity
and nation. This was the turning-point in the relations between
Essenism and Christianity, at least in Palestine. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Consequences of the Jewish war.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The Essenes were
extreme sufferers in the Roman war of extermination. It seems
probable that their organization was entirely broken up. Thus cast
adrift, they were free to enter into other combinations, while the
shock of the recent catastrophe would naturally turn their thoughts
into new channels. At the same time the nearer proximity of the
Christians, who had migrated to Peræa during the war, would bring
them into close contact with the new faith and subject them to its
influences, as they had never been subjected before<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c016'><sup>[497]</sup></a>. But, whatever
may be the explanation, the fact seems certain, that after the destruction
of Jerusalem the Christian body was largely reinforced from their
ranks. The Judaizing tendencies among the Hebrew Christians, which
hitherto had been wholly Pharisaic, are henceforth largely Essene.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Do the resemblances favour the theory of a connexion?</div>

<p class='c000'>2. If then history fails to reveal any such external connexion
with Essenism in Christ and His Apostles as to justify the opinion
that Essene influences contributed largely to the characteristic features
of the Gospel, such a view, if tenable at all, must find its support in
some striking coincidence between the doctrines and practices of the
Essenes and those which its Founder stamped upon Christianity.
This indeed is the really important point; for without it the external
connexion, even if proved, would be valueless. The question is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>not whether Christianity arose amid such and such circumstances,
but how far it was created and moulded by those circumstances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) Observance of the sabbath.</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) Now one point which especially strikes us in the Jewish
historian’s account of the Essenes, is their strict observance of
certain points in the Mosaic ceremonial law, more especially the
ultra-Pharisaic rigour with which they kept the sabbath. How far
their conduct in this respect was consistent with the teaching and
practice of Christ may be seen from the passages quoted in the
parallel columns which follow:</p>

<div class='column-container'>

<div class='column'>

<p class='c021'>‘Jesus went on the sabbath-day
through the corn fields; and his disciples
began to pluck the ears of corn and
to eat<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c016'><sup>[498]</sup></a>.... But when the Pharisees saw
it, they said unto him, ‘Behold, thy
disciples do that which it is not lawful
to do upon the sabbath-day. But he
said unto them, Have ye not read what
David did.... The sabbath was made
for man, and not man for the sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even
of the sabbath-day....’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘It is lawful to do well on the sabbath-days’
(Matt. xii. 1–12; Mark ii.
23.-iii. 6; Luke vi. 1–11, xiv. 1–6.
See also a similar incident in Luke
xiii. 10–17).
‘The Jews therefore said unto him
that was cured; It is the sabbath-day;
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
bed. But he answered them, He that
made me whole, the same said unto
me, Take up thy bed and walk....
Therefore the Jews did persecute Jesus
and sought to slay him, because he
did these things on the sabbath-day.
But Jesus answered them, My Father
worketh hitherto, and I work, etc.
(John v. 10–18; comp. vii. 22, 23).’
‘And it was the sabbath-day when
Jesus made the clay, and opened his
eyes.... Therefore said some of the
Pharisees, This man is not of God, because
he keepeth not the sabbath-day
(John ix. 14, 16).’</p>

</div>
<div class='column'>

<p class='c021'>‘And they avoid ... touching any work
(ἐφάπτεσθαι ἔργων) on the sabbath-day

a vessel<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c016'><sup>[499]</sup></a>, nor to perform the most necessary
offices of life (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 9).’

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) Lustrations and other ceremonial observances.</div>

<p class='c000'>(ii) But there were other points of ceremonial observance, in
which the Essenes superadded to the law. Of these the most remarkable
was their practice of constant lustrations. In this respect
the Pharisee was sufficiently minute and scrupulous in his observances;
but with the Essene these ablutions were the predominant
feature of his religious ritual. Here again it will be instructive
to compare the practice of Christ and His disciples with the practice
of the Essenes.</p>

<div class='column-container'>

<div class='column'>

<p class='c021'>‘And when they saw some of his

is to say, unwashen) hands; for the

<p class='c021'>‘After a year’s probation (the novice)

<p class='c021'>‘And when the Pharisee saw it, he

</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Avoidance of strangers.</div>

<p class='c000'>Connected with this idea of external purity is the avoidance of
contact with strangers, as persons who would communicate ceremonial
defilement. And here too the Essene went much beyond
the Pharisee. The Pharisee avoided Gentiles or aliens, or those
whose profession or character placed them in the category of
‘sinners’; but the Essene shrunk even from the probationers and
inferior grades of his own exclusive community. Here again we
may profitably compare the sayings and doings of Christ with the
principles of this sect.</p>

<div class='column-container'>

<div class='column'>

<p class='c021'>‘And when the scribes and Pharisees
saw him eat with the publicans
and sinners they said unto the disciples,
Why eateth your Master with the

ii. 15 sq.; Matth. ix. 10 sq., Luke v.
30 sq.)</p>

<p class='c021'>‘They say ... a friend of publicans

<p class='c021'>‘The Pharisees and the scribes murmured,

xv. 2).’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘They all murmured saying that he
was gone to be a guest with a man
that is a sinner (Luke xix. 7).’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘Behold, a woman in the city that
was a sinner ... began to wash his feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>with her tears, and did wipe them
with the hairs of her head and kissed
his feet.... Now when the Pharisee
which had bidden him saw it, he spake
within himself saying, This man, if
he had been a prophet, would have
known who and what manner of woman
this is that toucheth him; for
she is a sinner (Luke vii. 37 sq.).’</p>

</div>
<div class='column'>

<p class='c021'>‘And after this purification they
assemble in a private room, where no
person of a different belief (τῶν ἑτεροδόξων,
i.e. not an Essene) is permitted

and clean (αὐτοὶ καθαροὶ) they present
themselves at the refectory (δειπνητήριον),
as if it were a sacred precinct
(§ 5).’</p>
<p class='c022'>‘And they are divided into four
grades according to the time passed
under the discipline: and the juniors
are regarded as so far inferior to the
seniors, that, if they touch them, the
latter wash their bodies clean (ἀπολούεσθαι),
as if they had come in contact
with a foreigner (καθάπερ ἀλλοφύλῳ

</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In all these minute scruples relating to ceremonial observances,
the denunciations which are hurled against the Pharisees in the
Gospels would apply with tenfold force to the Essenes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iii) Asceticism.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iii) If the lustrations of the Essenes far outstripped the enactments
of the Mosaic law, so also did their asceticism. I have
given reasons above for believing that this asceticism was founded on
a false principle, which postulates the malignity of matter and is
wholly inconsistent with the teaching of the Gospel<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c016'><sup>[500]</sup></a>. But without
pressing this point, of which no absolutely demonstrative proof can be
given, it will be sufficient to call attention to the trenchant contrast
in practice which Essene habits present to the life of Christ. He
who ‘came eating and drinking’ and was denounced in consequence
as ‘a glutton and a wine-bibber’<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c016'><sup>[501]</sup></a>, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Eating and drinking.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>He whose first exercise of power
is recorded to have been the multiplication of wine at a festive entertainment,
and whose last meal was attended with the drinking of
wine and the eating of flesh, could only have excited the pity, if not
the indignation, of these rigid abstainers. And again, attention
should be directed to another kind of abstinence, where the contrast
is all the more speaking, because the matter is so trivial and the
scruple so minute.</p>

<div class='column-container'>

<div class='column'>

<p class='c000'>‘My head with oil thou didst not
anoint (Luke vii. 46).’</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy
head (Matt. vi. 17).’</p>

</div>
<div class='column'>

<p class='c000'>‘And they consider oil a pollution
(κηλῖδα), and though one is smeared
involuntarily, he rubs his body clean
(σμήχεται τὸ σῶμα, § 3).’</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>And yet it has been stated that ‘the Saviour of the world ...
showed what is required for a holy life in the Sermon on the Mount
by a description of the Essenes<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c016'><sup>[502]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Celibacy.</div>

<p class='c000'>But much stress has been laid on the celibacy of the Essenes;
and our Lord’s saying in Matt. xix. 12 is quoted to establish an
identity of doctrine. Yet there is nothing special in the language
there used. Nor is there any close affinity between the stern
invectives against marriage which Josephus and Philo attribute to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the Essene, and the gentle concession ‘He that is able to receive it,
let him receive it.’ The best comment on our Lord’s meaning here
is the advice of St Paul<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c016'><sup>[503]</sup></a>, who was educated not in the Essene, but
in the Pharisaic school. Moreover this saying must be balanced by
the general tenour of the Gospel narrative. When we find Christ
discussing the relations of man and wife, gracing the marriage
festival by His presence, again and again employing wedding banquets
and wedded life as apt symbols of the highest theological
truths, without a word of disparagement or rebuke, we see plainly
that we are confronted with a spirit very different from the narrow
rigour of the Essenes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iv) Avoidance of the Temple sacrifices.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iv) But not only where the Essenes superadded to the ceremonial
law, does their teaching present a direct contrast to the phenomena
of the Gospel narrative. The same is true also of those points
in which they fell short of the Mosaic enactments. I have already
discussed at some length the Essene abstention from the temple
sacrifices<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c016'><sup>[504]</sup></a>. There can, I think, be little doubt that they objected to
the slaughter of sacrificial victims altogether. But for my present
purpose it matters nothing whether they avoided the temple on
account of the sacrifices, or the sacrifices on account of the temple.
Christ did neither. Certainly He could not have regarded the
temple as unholy; for his whole time during his sojourns at Jerusalem
was spent within its precincts. It was the scene of His
miracles, of His ministrations, of His daily teaching<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c016'><sup>[505]</sup></a>. And in like
manner it is the common rendezvous of His disciples after Him<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c016'><sup>[506]</sup></a>.
Nor again does He evince any abhorrence of the sacrifices. On the
contrary He says that the altar consecrates the gifts<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c016'><sup>[507]</sup></a>; He charges
the cleansed lepers to go and fulfil the Mosaic ordinance and offer
the sacrificial offerings to the priests<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c016'><sup>[508]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Practice of Christ and His disciples.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>And His practice also is
conformable to His teaching. He comes to Jerusalem regularly to
attend the great festivals, where sacrifices formed the most striking
part of the ceremonial, and He himself enjoins preparation to be
made for the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb. If He repeats the
inspired warning of the older prophets, that mercy is better than
sacrifice<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c016'><sup>[509]</sup></a>, this very qualification shows approval of the practice in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>itself. Nor is His silence less eloquent than His utterances or His
actions. Throughout the Gospels there is not one word which can
be construed as condemning the sacrificial system or as implying a
desire for its cessation until everything is fulfilled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(v) Denial of the resurrection of the body.</div>

<p class='c000'>(v) This last contrast refers to the ceremonial law. But not
wide is the divergence on an important point of doctrine. The
resurrection of the body is a fundamental article in the belief of the
early disciples. This was distinctly denied by the Essenes<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c016'><sup>[510]</sup></a>. However
gross and sensuous may have been the conceptions of the
Pharisees on this point, still they so far agreed with the teaching of
Christianity, as against the Essenes, in that the risen man could not,
as they held, be pure soul or spirit, but must necessarily be body
and soul conjoint.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Some supposed coincidences considered.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus at whatever point we test the teaching and practice of our
Lord by the characteristic tenets of Essenism, the theory of affinity
fails. There are indeed several coincidences on which much stress
has been laid, but they cannot be placed in the category of distinctive
features. They are either exemplifications of a higher morality,
which may indeed have been honourably illustrated in the Essenes,
but is in no sense confined to them, being the natural outgrowth of
the moral sense of mankind whenever circumstances are favourable.
Or they are more special, but still independent developments, which
owe their similarity to the same influences of climate and soil,
though they do not spring from the same root. To this latter class
belong such manifestations as are due to the social conditions of the
age or nation, whether they result from sympathy with, or from
repulsion to, those conditions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Simplicity and brotherly love.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, for instance, much stress has been laid on the aversion to
war and warlike pursuits, on the simplicity of living, and on the
feeling of brotherhood which distinguished Christians and Essenes
alike. But what is gained by all this? It is quite plain that
Christ would have approved whatever was pure and lovely in the
morality of the Essenes, just as He approved whatever was true in
the doctrine of the Pharisees, if any occasion had presented itself
when His approval was called for. But it is the merest assumption
to postulate direct obligation on such grounds. It is said however,
that the moral resemblances are more particular than this. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Prohibition of oaths.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>There is
for instance Christ’s precept ‘Swear not at all ... but let your communication
be Yea, yea, Nay, nay.’ Have we not here, it is urged,
the very counterpart to the Essene prohibition of oaths<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c016'><sup>[511]</sup></a>? Yet it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>would surely be quite as reasonable to say that both alike enforce that
simplicity and truthfulness in conversation which is its own credential
and does not require the support of adjuration, both having the same
reason for laying stress on this duty, because the leaders of religious
opinion made artificial distinctions between oath and oath, as regards
their binding force, and thus sapped the foundations of public and
private honesty<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c016'><sup>[512]</sup></a>. And indeed this avoidance of oaths is anything
but a special badge of the Essenes. It was inculcated by Pythagoreans,
by Stoics, by philosophers and moralists of all schools<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c016'><sup>[513]</sup></a>.
When Josephus and Philo called the attention of Greeks and Romans
to this feature in the Essenes, they were simply asking them to
admire in these practical philosophers among the ‘barbarians’ the
realisation of an ideal which their own great men had laid down.
Even within the circles of Pharisaism language is occasionally heard,
which meets the Essene principle half-way<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c016'><sup>[514]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Community of goods.</div>

<p class='c000'>And again; attention has been called to the community of goods
in the infant Church of Christ, as though this were a legacy of Essenism.
But here too the reasonable explanation is, that we have
an independent attempt to realise the idea of brotherhood—an
attempt which naturally suggested itself without any direct imitation,
but which was soon abandoned under the pressure of circumstances.
Indeed the communism of the Christians was from the first wholly
unlike the communism of the Essenes. The surrender of property
with the Christians was not a necessary condition of entrance into
an order; it was a purely voluntary act, which might be withheld
without foregoing the privileges of the brotherhood<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c016'><sup>[515]</sup></a>. And the common
life too was obviously different in kind, at once more free and
more sociable, unfettered by rigid ordinances, respecting individual
liberty, and altogether unlike a monastic rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not less irrelevant is the stress, which has been laid on another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>point of supposed coincidence in the social doctrines of the two
communities. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Prohibition of slavery.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The prohibition of slavery was indeed a highly honourable
feature in the Essene order<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c016'><sup>[516]</sup></a>, but it affords no indication of a
direct connexion with Christianity. It is true that this social institution
of antiquity was not less antagonistic to the spirit of the
Gospel, than it was abhorrent to the feelings of the Essene; and ultimately
the influence of Christianity has triumphed over it. But the
immediate treatment of the question was altogether different in the
two cases. The Essene brothers proscribed slavery wholly; they
produced no appreciable results by the proscription. The Christian
Apostles, without attempting an immediate and violent revolution
in society, proclaimed the great principle that all men are equal in
Christ, and left it to work. It did work, like leaven, silently but
surely, till the whole lump was leavened. In the matter of slavery
the resemblance to the Stoic is much closer than to the Essene<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c016'><sup>[517]</sup></a>.
The Stoic however began and ended in barren declamation, and no
practical fruits were reaped from his doctrine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Respect paid to poverty.</div>

<p class='c000'>Moreover prominence has been given to the fact, that riches are
decried, and a preference is given to the poor, in the teaching of our
Lord and His Apostles. Here again, it is urged, we have a distinctly
Essene feature. We need not stop to enquire with what
limitations this prerogative of poverty, which appears in the Gospels,
must be interpreted; but, quite independently of this question, we may
fairly decline to lay any stress on such a coincidence, where all other
indications of a direct connexion have failed. The Essenes, pursuing a
simple and ascetic life, made it their chief aim to reduce their material
wants as far as possible, and in doing so they necessarily exalted
poverty. Ascetic philosophers in Greece and Rome had done the
same. Christianity was entrusted with the mission of proclaiming
the equal rights of all men before God, of setting a truer standard of
human worth than the outward conventions of the world, of protesting
against the tyranny of the strong and the luxury of the rich,
of redressing social inequalities, if not always by a present compensation,
at least by a future hope. The needy and oppressed were the
special charge of its preachers. It was the characteristic feature of
the ‘Kingdom of Heaven,’ as described by the prophet whose words
gave the keynote to the Messianic hopes of the nation, that the glad-tidings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>should be preached to the poor<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c016'><sup>[518]</sup></a>. The exaltation of poverty
therefore was an absolute condition of the Gospel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The preaching of the Kingdom wrongly ascribed to the Essenes.</div>

<p class='c000'>The mention of the kingdom of heaven leads to the last point
on which it will be necessary to touch before leaving this subject.
‘The whole ascetic life of the Essenes,’ it has been said, ‘aimed only
at furthering the <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> and the <em>Coming Age</em>.’ Thus
John the Baptist was the proper representative of this sect. ‘From
the Essenes went forth the first call that the Messiah must shortly
appear, <em>The kingdom of heaven is at</em> <em>hand</em>’<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c016'><sup>[519]</sup></a>. ‘The announcement of
the kingdom of heaven unquestionably went forth from the Essenes’<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c016'><sup>[520]</sup></a>.
For this confident assertion there is absolutely no foundation in fact;
and, as a conjectural hypothesis, the assumption is highly improbable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Essenes not prophets, but fortune-tellers.</div>

<p class='c000'>As fortune-tellers or soothsayers, the Essenes might be called
prophets; but as preachers of righteousness, as heralds of the kingdom,
they had no claim to the title. Throughout the notices in
Josephus and Philo we cannot trace the faintest indication of Messianic
hopes. Nor indeed was their position at all likely to foster
such hopes<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c016'><sup>[521]</sup></a>. The Messianic idea was built on a belief in the resurrection
of the body. The Essenes entirely denied this doctrine.
The Messianic idea was intimately bound up with the national hopes
and sufferings, with the national life, of the Jews. The Essenes had
no interest in the Jewish polity; they separated themselves almost
entirely from public affairs. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>They had no vivid Messianic expectations.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The deliverance of the individual is the
shipwreck of the whole, it has been well said, was the plain watchword
of Essenism<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c016'><sup>[522]</sup></a>. How entirely the conception of a Messiah might
be obliterated, where Judaism was regarded only from the side of a
mystic philosophy, we see from the case of Philo. Throughout the
works of this voluminous writer only one or two faint and doubtful
allusions to a personal Messiah are found<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c016'><sup>[523]</sup></a>. The philosophical tenets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of the Essenes no doubt differed widely from those of Philo; but in
the substitution of the individual and contemplative aspect of religion
for the national and practical they were united; and the effect
in obscuring the Messianic idea would be the same. When therefore
it is said that the prominence given to the proclamation of the
Messiah’s kingdom is a main link which connects Essenism and
Christianity, we may dismiss the statement as a mere hypothesis,
unsupported by evidence and improbable in itself.</p>

<h3 class='c023'>III. <br /> CHARACTER AND CONTENTS OF THE EPISTLE.</h3>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c015'>The understanding of the heresy necessary.</div>

<p class='c000'>Without the preceding investigation the teaching of this
epistle would be very imperfectly understood; for its
direction was necessarily determined by the occasion which gave
rise to it. Only when we have once grasped the nature of
the doctrine which St Paul is combating, do we perceive that
every sentence is instinct with life and meaning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The errors though twofold sprang from one root.</div>

<p class='c000'>We have seen that the error of the heretical teachers was
twofold. They had a false conception in theology, and they had
a false basis of morals. It has been pointed out also, that these
two were closely connected together, and had their root in the
same fundamental error, the idea of matter as the abode of evil
and thus antagonistic to God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>So the answer to both is in the same truth.</div>

<p class='c000'>As the two elements of the heretical doctrine were derived
from the same source, so the reply to both was sought by the
Apostle in the same idea, the conception of the Person of Christ
as the one absolute mediator between God and man, the true
and only reconciler of heaven and earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though they are thus ultimately connected, yet it will
be necessary for the fuller understanding of St Paul’s position
to take them apart, and to consider first the theological and
then the ethical teaching of the epistle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The <em>theological</em> teaching of the heretics.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. This Colossian heresy was no coarse and vulgar development
of falsehood. It soared far above the Pharisaic Judaism
which St Paul refutes in the Epistle to the Galatians. The
questions in which it was interested lie at the very root of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>religious consciousness. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its lofty motive,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The impulse was given to its speculations
by an overwhelming sense of the unapproachable
majesty of God, by an instinctive recognition of the chasm
which separates God from man, from the world, from matter.
Its energy was sustained by the intense yearning after some
mediation which might bridge over this chasm, might establish
inter-communion between the finite and the Infinite. Up to
this point it was deeply religious in the best sense of the term.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>but complete failure.</div>

<p class='c000'>The answer which it gave to these questions we have
already seen. In two respects this answer failed signally. On
the one hand it was drawn from the atmosphere of mystical
speculation. It had no foundation in history, and made no
appeal to experience. On the other hand, notwithstanding
its complexity, it was unsatisfactory in its results; for in this
plurality of mediators none was competent to meet the requirements
of the case. God here and man there—no angel or
spirit, whether one or more, being neither God nor man, could
truly reconcile the two. Thus as regards credentials it was
without a guarantee; while as regards efficiency it was wholly
inadequate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Apostle’s answer is in the Person of Christ.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Apostle pointed out to the Colossians a more excellent
way. It was the one purpose of Christianity to satisfy those
very yearnings which were working in their hearts, to solve
that very problem which had exercised their minds. In Christ
they would find the answer which they sought. His life—His
cross and resurrection—was the guarantee; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The mediator in the world and in the Church.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>His Person—the
Word Incarnate—was the solution. He alone filled up, He
alone could fill up, the void which lay between God and man,
could span the gulf which separated the Creator and creation.
This solution offered by the Gospel is as simple as it is adequate.
To their cosmical speculations, and to their religious
yearnings alike, Jesus Christ is the true answer. In the
World, as in the Church, He is the one only mediator, the one
only reconciler. This two-fold idea runs like a double thread
through the fabric of the Apostle’s teaching in those passages
of the epistle where he is describing the Person of Christ.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>It will be convenient for the better understanding of St
Paul’s teaching to consider these two aspects of Christ’s mediation
apart—its function in the natural and in the spiritual
order respectively.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) In the <em>Universe</em>.</div>

<p class='c000'>(i) The heresy of the Colossian teachers took its rise, as
we saw, in their cosmical speculations. It was therefore natural
that the Apostle in replying should lay stress on the function
of the Word in the creation and government of the world.
This is the aspect of His work most prominent in the first
of the two distinctly Christological passages. The Apostle
there predicates of the Word, not only prior, but absolute
existence. All things were created through Him, are sustained
in Him, are tending towards Him. Thus He is the beginning,
middle, and end, of creation. This He is, because He
is the very <em>image</em> of the Invisible God, because in Him dwells
the <em>plenitude</em> of Deity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Importance of this aspect of the Person of Christ,</div>

<p class='c000'>This creative and administrative work of Christ the Word
in the natural order of things is always emphasized in the
writings of the Apostles, when they touch upon the doctrine
of His Person. It stands in the forefront of the prologue to
St John’s Gospel: it is hardly less prominent in the opening
of the Epistle to the Hebrews. His mediatorial function in the
Church is represented as flowing from His mediatorial function
in the world. With ourselves this idea has retired very
much into the background. Though in the creed common
to all the Churches we profess our belief in Him, as the Being
‘through whom all things were created,’ yet in reality
this confession seems to exercise very little influence on our
thoughts. And the loss is serious. How much our theological
conceptions suffer in breadth and fulness by the neglect, a
moment’s reflexion will show. How much more hearty would be
the sympathy of theologians with the revelations of science and
the developments of history, if they habitually connected them
with the operation of the same Divine Word who is the centre
of all their religious aspirations, it is needless to say. Through
the recognition of this idea with all the consequences which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>flow from it, as a living influence, more than in any other way,
may we hope to strike the chords of that ‘vaster music,’ which
results only from the harmony of knowledge and faith, of reverence
and research.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>notwithstanding difficulties yet unsolved.</div>

<p class='c000'>It will be said indeed, that this conception leaves untouched
the philosophical difficulties which beset the subject;
that creation still remains as much a mystery as before.
This may be allowed. But is there any reason to think that
with our present limited capacities the veil which shrouds it
ever will be or can be removed? The metaphysical speculations
of twenty-five centuries have done nothing to raise it.
The physical investigations of our own age from their very
nature can do nothing; for, busied with the evolution of phenomena,
they lie wholly outside this question, and do not even
touch the fringe of the difficulty. But meanwhile revelation
has interposed and thrown out the idea, which, if it leaves
many questions unsolved, gives a breadth and unity to our
conceptions, at once satisfying our religious needs and linking
our scientific instincts with our theological beliefs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) In the <em>Church</em>.</div>

<p class='c000'>(ii) But, if Christ’s mediatorial office in the physical creation
was the starting point of the Apostle’s teaching, His
mediatorial office in the spiritual creation is its principal theme.
The cosmogonies of the false teachers were framed not so
much in the interests of philosophy as in the interests of religion;
and the Apostle replies to them in the same spirit
and with the same motive. If the function of Christ is unique
in the Universe, so is it also in the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its absolute character.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>He is the sole
and absolute link between God and humanity. Nothing short
of His personality would suffice as a medium of reconciliation
between the two. Nothing short of His life and work
in the flesh, as consummated in His passion, would serve as
an assurance of God’s love and pardon. His cross is the atonement
of mankind with God. He is the Head with whom
all the living members of the body are in direct and immediate
communication, who suggests their manifold activities
to each, who directs their several functions in subordination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to the healthy working of the whole, from whom they individually
receive their inspiration and their strength.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hence angelic mediations are fundamentally wrong.</div>

<p class='c000'>And being all this He cannot consent to share His prerogative
with others. He absorbs in Himself the whole function
of mediation. Through Him alone, without any interposing
link of communication, the human soul has access to the
Father. Here was the true answer to those deep yearnings after
spiritual communion with God, which sought, and could not
find, satisfaction in the manifold and fantastic creations of a
dreamy mysticism. The worship of angels might have the
semblance of humility; but it was in fact a contemptuous
defiance of the fundamental idea of the Gospel, a flat denial
of the absolute character of Christ’s Person and office. It
was a severance of the proper connexion with the Head, an
amputation of the disordered limb, which was thus disjoined
from the source of life and left to perish for want of spiritual
nourishment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Christ’s mediation in the Church justified by His mediation in the World.</div>

<p class='c000'>The language of the New Testament writers is beset with
difficulties, so long as we conceive of our Lord only in connexion
with the Gospel revelation: but, when with the Apostles
we realise in Him the same Divine Lord who is and
ever has been the light of the whole world, who before Christianity
wrought first in mankind at large through the avenues
of the conscience, and afterwards more particularly in the Jews
through a special though still imperfect revelation, then all
these difficulties fall away. Then we understand the significance,
and we recognise the truth, of such passages as these:
‘No man cometh unto the Father, but by me’: ‘There is no
salvation in any other’; ‘He that disbelieveth the Son shall
not see life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c016'><sup>[524]</sup></a>.’ The
exclusive claims advanced in Christ’s name have their full and
perfect justification in the doctrine of the Eternal Word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation of the doctrine of the Word</div>

<p class='c000'>The old dispensation is primarily the revelation of the absolute
sovereignty of God. It vindicates this truth against two
opposing forms of error, which in their extreme types are represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>by Pantheism and Manicheism respectively. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>to the monotheism of the Old Testament.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The Pantheist
identifies God with the world: the Manichee attributes
to the world an absolute existence, independent of God. With
the Pantheist sin ceases to have any existence: for it is only
one form of God’s working. With the Manichee sin is inherent
in matter, which is antagonistic to God. The teaching
of the Old Testament, of which the key-note is struck in the
opening chapters of Genesis, is a refutation of both these errors.
God is distinct from the world, and He is the Creator of
the world. Evil is not inherent in God, but neither is it inherent
in the material world. Sin is the disobedience of intelligent
beings whom He has created, and whom He has
endowed with a free-will, which they can use or misuse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The New Testament is complementary to the Old.</div>

<p class='c000'>The revelation of the New Testament is the proper complement
to the revelation of the Old. It holds this position in
two main respects. If the Old Testament sets forth the absolute
unity of God—His distinctness from and sovereignty over
His creatures—the New Testament points out how He holds
communion with the world and with humanity, how man
becomes one with Him. And again, if the Old Testament
shows the true character of sin, the New Testament teaches
the appointed means of redemption. On the one hand the
monotheism of the Old Testament is supplemented by the
theanthropism<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c016'><sup>[525]</sup></a> of the New. Thus the <em>theology</em> of revelation is
completed. On the other hand, the hamartiology of the Old
Testament has its counterpart in the soteriology of the New.
Thus the <em>economy</em> of revelation is perfected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. The <em>ethical</em> error of the heretics.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>2. When we turn from the theology of these Colossian
heretics to their ethical teaching, we find it characterised by
the same earnestness. Of them it might indeed be said that
they did ‘hunger and thirst after righteousness.’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their practical earnestness,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Escape from
impurity, immunity from evil, was a passion with them. But
it was no less true that notwithstanding all their sincerity they
‘went astray in the wilderness’; ‘hungry and thirsty, their soul
fainted within them.’ By their fatal transference of the abode of
sin from the human heart within to the material world without,
they had incapacitated themselves from finding the true antidote.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>but fundamental misconception and consequent failure.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Where they placed the evil, there they necessarily sought
the remedy. Hence they attempted to fence themselves about,
and to purify their lives by a code of rigorous prohibitions.
Their energy was expended on battling with the physical conditions
of human life. Their whole mind was absorbed in
the struggle with imaginary forms of evil. Necessarily their
character was moulded by the thoughts which habitually engaged
them. Where the ‘elements of the world,’ the ‘things
which perish in the using<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c016'><sup>[526]</sup></a>,’ engrossed all their attention, it
could not fail but that they should be dragged down from the
serene heights of the spiritual life into the cloudy atmosphere
which shrouds this lower earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul substitutes a principle for ordinances.</div>

<p class='c000'>St Paul sets himself to combat this false tendency. For
negative prohibitions he substitutes a positive principle; for
special enactments, a comprehensive motive. He tells them
that all their scrupulous restrictions are vain, because they fail
to touch the springs of action. If they would overcome the
evil, they must strike at the root of the evil. Their point of
view must be entirely changed. They must transfer themselves
into a wholly new sphere of energy. This transference
is nothing less than a migration from earth to heaven—from
the region of the external and transitory to the region of
the spiritual and eternal<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c016'><sup>[527]</sup></a>. For a code of rules they must
substitute a principle of life, which is one in its essence but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>infinite in its application, which will meet every emergency,
will control every action, will resist every form of evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>This principle is the heavenly life in Christ.</div>

<p class='c000'>This principle they have in Christ. With Him they have
died to the world; with Him they have risen to God. Christ,
the revelation of God’s holiness, of God’s righteousness, of
God’s love, is light, is life, is heaven. With Him they have been
translated into a higher sphere, have been brought face to face
with the Eternal Presence. Let them only realise this translation.
It involves new insight, new motives, new energies.
They will no more waste themselves upon vexatious special
restrictions: for they will be furnished with a higher inspiration
which will cover all the minute details of action. They will
not exhaust their energies in crushing this or that rising desire
but they will kill the whole body<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c016'><sup>[528]</sup></a> of their earthly passions
through the strong arm of this personal communion with God
in Christ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul’s doctrine of faith and works considered in the light of this principle.</div>

<p class='c000'>When we once grasp this idea, which lies at the root of
St Paul’s ethical teaching, the moral difficulty which is supposed
to attach to his doctrine of faith and works has vanished.
It is simply an impossibility that faith should exist without
works. Though in form he states his doctrine as a relation of
contrast between the two, in substance it resolves itself into
a question of precedence. Faith and works are related as
principle and practice. Faith—the repose in the unseen, the
recognition of eternal principles of truth and right, the sense
of personal obligations to an Eternal Being who vindicates
these principles—must come first. Faith is not an intellectual
assent, nor a sympathetic sentiment merely. It is the absolute
surrender of self to the will of a Being who has a right to
command this surrender. It is this which places men in
personal relation to God, which (in St Paul’s language) justifies
them before God. For it touches the springs of their actions;
it fastens not on this or that detail of conduct, but extends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>throughout the whole sphere of moral activity; and thus it
determines their character as responsible beings in the sight
of God.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>The Christology of this epistle</div>

<p class='c000'>From the above account it will have appeared that the distinctive
feature of this epistle is its Christology. The doctrine
of the Person of Christ is here stated with greater precision
and fulness than in any other of St Paul’s epistles. It is
therefore pertinent to ask (even though the answer must necessarily
be brief) what relation this statement bears to certain
other enunciations of the same doctrine; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>considered in relation to<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>to those for instance
which occur elsewhere in St Paul’s own letters, to those which
are found in other Apostolic writings, and to those which
appear in the fathers of the succeeding generations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. The Christology of St Paul’s earlier epistles</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The Christology of the Colossian Epistle is in no way
different from that of the Apostle’s earlier letters. It may
indeed be called a development of his former teaching, but only
as exhibiting the doctrine in fresh relations, as drawing new
deductions from it, as defining what had hitherto been left undefined,
not as superadding any foreign element to it. The
doctrine is practically involved in the opening and closing words
of his earliest extant epistle: ‘The Church which is in God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ’; ‘The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with you<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c016'><sup>[529]</sup></a>.’ The main conception of the Person
of Christ, as enforced in the Colossian Epistle, alone justifies and
explains this language, which otherwise would be emptied of all
significance. And again; it had been enunciated by the Apostle
explicitly, though briefly, in the earliest directly doctrinal passage
which bears on the subject; ‘One Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom are all things and we through Him<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c016'><sup>[530]</sup></a>.’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>the same in substance but<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The absolute
universal mediation of the Son is declared as unreservedly in
this passage from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, as in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>later statement of the Apostle: and, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>less fully developed<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>if all the doctrinal and
practical inferences which it implicitly involves were not
directly emphasized at this early date, it was because the circumstances
did not yet require explicitness on these points.
New forms of error bring into prominence new aspects of the
truth. The heresies of Laodicea and Colossæ have been invaluable
to the later Church in this respect. The Apostle himself,
it is not too much to say, realised with ever increasing force the
manifoldness, the adaptability, the completeness of the Christian
idea, notwithstanding its simplicity, as he opposed it to each
successive development of error. The Person of Christ proved
the complete answer to false speculations at Colossæ, as it had
been found the sovereign antidote to false practices at Corinth.
All these unforeseen harmonies must have appeared to him, as
they will appear to us, fresh evidences of its truth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. The Christology of other Apostolic writings.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their fundamental identity.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c000'>2. And when we turn from St Paul to the other Apostolic
writings which dwell on the Person of Christ from a doctrinal
point of view, we find them enunciating it in language which
implies the same fundamental conception, though they may not
always present it in exactly the same aspect. More especially
in the Epistle to the Hebrews first, and in the Gospel of St
John afterwards, the form of expression is identical with the
statement of St Paul. In both these writings the universe is
said to have been created or to exist <em>by</em> or <em>through</em> Him.
This is the crucial expression, which involves in itself all
the higher conceptions of the Person of Christ<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c016'><sup>[531]</sup></a>. The Epistle
to the Hebrews seems to have been written by a disciple of
St Paul immediately after the Apostle’s death, and therefore
within some five or six years from the date which has been
assigned to the Colossian letter. The Gospel of St John, if the
traditional report may be accepted, dates about a quarter of a
century later; but it is linked with our epistle by the fact that
the readers for whom it was primarily intended belonged to the
neighbouring districts of Proconsular Asia. Thus it illustrates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and is illustrated by, the teaching of St Paul in this letter.
More especially by the emphatic use of the term <em>Logos</em>, which
St Paul for some reason has suppressed, it supplies the centre
round which the ideas gather, and thus gives unity and directness
to the conception.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Firmness of the apostolic idea.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the Christology of these Apostolic writings there is a firmness
and precision which leaves no doubt about the main conception
present to the mind of the writers. The idea of Christ
as an intermediate being, neither God nor man, is absolutely and
expressly excluded. On the one hand His humanity is distinctly
emphasized. On the other He is represented as existing from

mediator in the creation and government of the world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. The Christology of the succeeding ages.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. But, when we turn from these Apostolic statements to
the writings of succeeding generations, we are struck with the
contrast<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c016'><sup>[532]</sup></a>. A vagueness, a flaccidity, of conception betrays itself
in their language.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its looseness of conception.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the Apostolic Fathers and in the earlier Apologists we
find indeed for the most part a <em>practical</em> appreciation of the
Person of Christ, which leaves nothing to be desired; but as
soon as they venture upon any directly dogmatic statement, we
miss at once the firmness of grasp and clearness of conception
which mark the writings of the Apostles. If they desire to
emphasize the majesty of His Person, they not unfrequently fall
into language which savours of patripassianism<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c016'><sup>[533]</sup></a>. If on the other
hand they wish to present Him in His mediatorial capacity,
they use words which seem to imply some divine being, who
is God and yet not quite God, neither Creator nor creature<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c016'><sup>[534]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Apostolic idea applied in later ages.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The Church needed a long education, before she was fitted
to be the expositor of the true Apostolic doctrine. A conflict
of more than two centuries with Gnostics, Ebionites, Sabellians,
Arians, supplied the necessary discipline. The true successors
of the Apostles in this respect are not the fathers of the second
century, but the fathers of the third and fourth centuries. In the
expositors of the Nicene age we find indeed technical terms
and systematic definitions, which we do not find in the Apostles
themselves; but, unless I have wholly misconceived the nature
of the heretical teaching at Colossæ and the purport of St Paul’s
reply, the main idea of Christ’s Person, with which he here
confronts this Gnostic Judaism, is essentially the same as that
which the fathers of these later centuries opposed to the Sabellianism
and the Arianism of their own age. If I mistake not,
the more distinctly we realise the nature of the heresy, the
more evident will it become that any conception short of the
perfect deity and perfect humanity of Christ would not have
furnished a satisfactory answer; and this is the reason why
I have dwelt at such length on the character of the Colossian
false teaching, and why I venture to call especial attention to
this part of my subject.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Style of this epistle.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the style of the letter to the Colossians I shall have occasion
to speak hereafter, when I come to discuss its genuineness.
It is sufficient to say here, that while the hand of St Paul
is unmistakable throughout this epistle, we miss the flow and
the versatility of the Apostle’s earlier letters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its ruggedness and compression,</div>

<p class='c000'>A comparison with the Epistles to the Corinthians and to the
Philippians will show the difference. It is distinguished from
them by a certain ruggedness of expression, a ‘want of finish’
often bordering on obscurity. What account should be given of
this characteristic, it is impossible to say. The divergence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>style is not greater than will appear in the letters of any active-minded
man, written at different times and under different
circumstances. The epistles which I have selected for contrast
suggest that the absence of all personal connexion with the
Colossian Church will partially, if not wholly, explain the diminished
fluency of this letter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>but essential vigour.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>At the same time no epistle of
St Paul is more vigorous in conception or more instinct with
meaning. It is the very compression of the thoughts which
creates the difficulty. If there is a want of fluency, there is no
want of force. Feebleness is the last charge which can be
brought against this epistle.</p>

<p class='c032'><a id='I_1'></a>ΠΑΥΛΟΣ ἀπόστολος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ διὰ θελήματος
Θεοῦ, καὶ Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδελφός, <a id='I_2'></a><sup>2</sup>τοῖς ἐν Κολοσσαῖς<a href='#Page_198'> ></a></p>

<p class='c033'>1, 2. ‘<span class='sc'>Paul</span>, an apostle of Christ
Jesus by no personal merit but by
God’s gracious will alone, and <span class='sc'>Timothy</span>,
our brother in the faith, to the consecrated
people of God in Colossæ, the
brethren who are stedfast in their
allegiance and faithful in Christ. May
grace the well-spring of all mercies, and
peace the crown of all blessings, be
bestowed upon you from God our
Father.’</p>

<p class='c034'>1. ἀπόστολος] On the exceptional
omission of this title in some of St
Paul’s epistles see Phil. i. 1. Though
there is no reason for supposing that
his authority was directly impugned
in the Colossian Church, yet he interposes
by virtue of his Apostolic commission
and therefore uses his authoritative
title.</p>

<p class='c034'>διὰ θελήματος Θεοῦ] As in 1 Cor. i. 1,
2 Cor. i. 1, Ephes. i. 1, 2 Tim. i. 1.
These passages show that the words
cannot have a polemical bearing. If
they had been directed against those
who questioned his Apostleship, they
would probably have taken a stronger
form. The expression must therefore
be regarded as a renunciation of all
personal worth, and a declaration of
God’s unmerited grace; comp. Rom.
ix. 16 ἄρα οὖν οὐ τοῦ θέλοντος οὐδὲ
τοῦ τρέχοντος ἀλλὰ τοῦ ἐλεῶντος θεοῦ.
The same words διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ are
used in other connexions in Rom. xv.
32, 2 Cor. viii. 5, where no polemical
reference is possible.</p>

<p class='c034'>Τιμόθεος] The name of this disciple
is attached to the Apostle’s own in
the heading of the Philippian letter,
which was probably written at an
earlier stage in his Roman captivity.
It appears also in the same connexion
in the Epistle to Philemon, but not in
the Epistle to the Ephesians, though
these two letters were contemporaneous
with one another and with the
Colossian letter. For an explanation
of the omission, see the introduction
to that epistle.</p>

<p class='c034'>In the Epistles to the Philippians
and to Philemon the presence of Timothy
is forgotten at once (see Phil.
i. 1). In this epistle the plural is
maintained throughout the thanksgiving
(vv. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9), but afterwards
dropped, when the Apostle begins
to speak in his own person (i. 23,
24), and so he continues to the end.
The exceptions (i. 28, iv. 3) are rather
apparent than real.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὁ ἀδελφός] Timothy is again designated
simply ‘the brother’ in 2 Cor.
i. 1, Philem. 1, but not in Heb. xiii. 23,
where the right reading is τὸν ἀδελφὸν
ἡμῶν. The same designation is used
of Quartus (Rom. xvi. 23), of Sosthenes
(1 Cor. i. 1), of Apollos (1 Cor. xvi. 12);
comp. 2 Cor. viii. 18, ix. 3, 5, xii. 18.
As some designation seemed to be
required, and as Timothy could not
be called an Apostle (see <cite>Galatians</cite>,
p. 96, note 2), this, as the simplest
title, would naturally suggest itself.</p>

<p class='c034'>2. Κολοσσαῖς] For the reasons
why this form is preferred here, while
Κολασσαεῖς is adopted in the heading
of the epistle, see above, p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a> sq.</p>

<a href='#Page_199'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>ἁγίοις] ‘<em>saints</em>,’ i.e. the people consecrated
to God, the Israel of the new
covenant; see the note on Phil. i. 1.
This mode of address marks the later
epistles of St Paul. In his earlier
letters (1, 2 Thess., 1, 2 Cor., Gal.) he
writes τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις. The
change begins with the Epistle to the
Romans, and from that time forward
the Apostle always uses ἁγίοις in
various combinations in addressing
Churches (Rom., Phil., Col., Ephes.).
For a similar phenomenon, serving as a chronological mark, see the note on
ἡ χάρις, iv. 18. The word ἁγίοις must
here be treated as a substantive in
accordance with its usage in parallel
passages, and not as an adjective connected
with ἀδελφοῖς. See the next
note.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς] This unusual
addition is full of meaning. Some
members of the Colossian Church were
shaken in their allegiance, even if they
had not fallen from it. The Apostle
therefore wishes it to be understood
that, when he speaks of the saints, he
means the true and stedfast members
of the brotherhood. In this way he
obliquely hints at the defection. Thus
the words καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς are a
supplementary explanation of τοῖς ἁγίοις.
He does not directly exclude
any, but he indirectly warns all. The
epithet πιστὸς cannot mean simply
‘believing’; for then it would add nothing
which is not already contained
in ἁγίοις and ἀδελφοῖς. Its passive
sense, ‘trustworthy, stedfast, unswerving,’
must be prominent here, as in
Acts xvi. 15 εἰ κεκρίκατέ με πιστὴν τῷ
Κυρίῳ εἶναι. See <cite>Galatians</cite> p. 155.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν Χριστῷ] most naturally connected
with both words πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς,
though referring chiefly to πιστοῖς;
comp. Ephes. vi. 21 πιστὸς δίακονος ἐν
Κυρίῳ, 1 Tim. i. 2 γνησίῳ τέκνῳ ἐν πίστει.
For the expression πιστὸς ἐν
Χριστῷ, ἐν Κυρίῳ, see also 1 Cor. iv. 17,
Ephes. i. 1. The Apostle assumes
that the Colossian brethren are ‘stedfast
in Christ.’ Their state thus contrasts
with the description of the heretical
teacher, who (ii. 19) οὐ κρατεῖ
τὴν κεφαλήν.</p>

<p class='c034'>χάρις κ.τ.λ.] On this form of salutation
see the note to 1 Thess. i. 1.</p>

<p class='c034'>πατρὸς ἡμῶν] The only instance in
St Paul’s epistles, where the name of
the Father stands alone in the opening
benediction without the addition
of Jesus Christ. The omission was
noticed by Origen (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rom.</cite></span> 1. § 8, <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p.
467), and by Chrysostom (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad loc.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>XI.</span> p.
324, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hom. in 2 Cor.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>XXX</span>, x. p. 651). But
transcribers naturally aimed at uniformity,
and so in many copies we find
the addition καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.
The only other exception to the Apostle’s
usual form is in 1 Thessalonians,
where the benediction is shorter still,
χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, and where likewise
the copyists have supplied words
to lengthen it out in accordance with
St Paul’s common practice.</p>

<p class='c034'>3–8. ‘We never cease to pour
forth our thanksgiving to God the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ on
your account, whensoever we pray to
Him. We are full of thankfulness
for the tidings of the <em>faith</em> which ye
have in Christ Jesus, and the <em>love</em> which
ye show towards all the people of God,
while ye look forward to the <em>hope</em>
which is stored up for you in heaven
as a treasure for the life to come.
This hope was communicated to you
in those earlier lessons, when the Gospel
was preached to you in its purity
and integrity—the one universal unchangeable
Gospel, which was made
known to you, even as it was carried
throughout the world, approving itself
by its fruits wheresoever it is planted.
For, as elsewhere, so also in you,
these fruits were manifested from the
first day when ye received your lessons
in, and apprehended the power of, the
genuine Gospel, which is not a law of
ordinances but a dispensation of grace,
not a device of men but a truth of
God. Such was the word preached to
you by Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant
in our Master’s household,
who in our absence and on our behalf
has ministered to you the Gospel of
Christ, and who now brings back to us
the welcome tidings of the love which
ye show in the Spirit.’</p>

<p class='c034'>3. εὐχαριστοῦμεν] See the notes on
1 Thess. i. 2.</p>

<p class='c034'>πατρὶ] If the καὶ be omitted, as the
balance of authorities appears to suggest,
the form of words here is quite
exceptional. Elsewhere it runs ὁ θεὸς
καὶ πατὴρ τοῦ Κυρίου, Rom. <span class='fss'>XV.</span> 6, 2 Cor.
i. 3, xi. 31, Ephes. i. 3 (v.l.), 1 Pet. i.
3; comp. Rev. i. 6: and in analogous
cases, such as ὁ θεὸς καὶ πατὴρ ἡμῶν,
the rule is the same. See the note on
Clem. Rom. § 7. In iii. 17 however
we have τῷ θεῷ πατρί, where the evidence
is more decisive and the expression
quite as unusual. On the
authorities for the various readings
here see the detached note.</p>

<p class='c033'>πάντοτε κ.τ.λ.] We here meet the
same difficulty about the connexion of
the clauses, which confronts us in
several of St Paul’s opening thanksgivings.
The words πάντοτε and περὶ
ὑμῶν must clearly be taken together,
because the emphasis of περὶ ὑμῶν
would be inexplicable, if it stood at
the beginning of a clause. But are
they to be attached to the preceding or
to the following sentence? The connexion
with the previous words is favoured
by St Paul’s usual conjunction
of εὐχαριστεῖν πάντοτε (see the note on
Phil. i. 3), and by the parallel passage
οὐ παύομαι εὐχαριστῶν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν in
Ephes. i. 16. Thus the words will
mean ‘<em>We give thanks for you always
in our prayers</em>.’ For this absolute
use of προσευχόμενοι see Matt. vi. 7,
Acts xvi. 25.</p>

<p class='c034'>4. ἀκούσαντες] ‘<em>having heard</em>’ from
Epaphras (ver. 8); for the Apostle had
no direct personal knowledge of the
Colossian Church: see the introduction,
p. <a href='#Page_27'>27</a> sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ] to be connected
with τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν. The strict classical
language would require τὴν ἐν
Χ. Ἰ., but the omission of the article is
common to the New Testament (e.g.
ver. 8); see the note on 1 Thess. i. 1,
and Winer § xx. p. 169 (ed. Moulton).
The preposition ἐν here and in the parallel
passage, Ephes. i. 15, denotes the
sphere in which their faith moves,
rather than the object to which it is
directed (comp. 1 Cor. iii. 5); for, if
the object had been meant, the natural
preposition would have been ἐπὶ
or εἰς (e.g. ii. 5). This is probably the
case also in the passages where at
first sight it might seem otherwise,
e.g. 1 Tim. iii. 13, 2 Tim. iii. 15; for
compare 2 Tim. i. 13 ἐν πίστει καὶ
ἀγάπῃ τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, where the
meaning is unambiguous. There is
however authority in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> for the
use of ἐν with πίστις, πιστεύειν, to denote
the object, in Jer. xii. 6, Ps.
lxxviii. 22, and perhaps in Mark i. 15,
Rom. iii. 25, and (more doubtfully still)
in Joh. iii. 15.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἣν ἔχετε] See the detached note on
the various readings.</p>

<p class='c034'>5. διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα] ‘<em>for the hope</em>,’ i.e.
looking to the hope. The following
reasons seem decisive in favour of connecting
διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα, not with εὐχαριστοῦμεν,
but with τὴν πίστιν κ.τ.λ.,
whether ἣν ἔχετε be retained or not.
(1) The great distance of εὐχαριστοῦμεν
is against the former connexion;
(2) The following clause, ἣν προηκοῦσατε
κ.τ.λ., suggests that the words
διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα describe the motives of
the Colossians for well-doing, rather
than the reasons of the Apostle for
thanksgiving: (3) The triad of Christian
graces, which St Paul delights to
associate together, would otherwise be
broken up. This last argument seems
conclusive; see especially the corresponding
thanksgiving in 1 Thess. i. 3,
μνημονεῦοντες ὑμῶν τοῦ ἔργου τῆς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>πίστεως</em>&nbsp;
καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀγάπης</em>&nbsp; καὶ
τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐλπίδος</em>&nbsp; κ.τ.λ., with
the note there. The order is the same
here, as there; and it is the natural
sequence. Faith rests on the past;
love works in the present; hope looks
to the future. They may be regarded
as the efficient, material, and
final causes respectively of the spiritual
life. Compare Polycarp <cite>Phil.</cite> 3
πίστιν ἥτις ἐστὶ μήτηρ πάντων ἡμῶν,
ἐπακολουθούσης τῆς ἐλπίδος, προαγούσης
τῆς ἀγάπης.</p>

<p class='c034'>The hope here is identified with the
object of the hope: see the passages
quoted on Gal. v. 5. The sense of
ἐλπίς, as of the corresponding words
in any language, oscillates between the
subjective feeling and the objective
realisation; comp. Rom. viii. 24 τῇ
γὰρ ἐλπίδι ἐσώθημεν· ἐλπὶς δὲ βλεπομένη
οὐκ ἔστιν ἐλπίς· ὃ γὰρ βλέπει τις

the one to the other.</p>

<p class='c033'>τὴν ἀποκειμένην] ‘<em>which is stored
up</em>.’ It is the θησαυρὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ of
the Gospels (Matt. vi. 20, 21, Luke xii.
34, xviii. 22).</p>

<p class='c034'>προηκούσατε] ‘<em>of which ye were
told in time past</em>.’ The preposition
seems intended to contrast their
earlier with their later lessons—the
true Gospel of Epaphras with the false
gospel of their recent teachers (see
the next note). The expression would
gain force, if we might suppose that
the heretical teachers obscured or
perverted the doctrine of the resurrection
(comp. 2 Tim. ii. 18); and their
speculative tenets were not unlikely
to lead to such a result. But this is
not necessary; for under any circumstances
the false doctrine, as leading
them astray, tended to cheat them of
their hope; see ver. 23. The common
interpretations, which explain προ- as
meaning either ‘before its fulfilment’
or ‘before my writing to you,’ seem
neither so natural in themselves nor
so appropriate to the context.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου] ‘<em>the
truth of the Gospel</em>,’ i.e. the true and
genuine Gospel as taught by Epaphras,
and not the spurious substitute of
these later pretenders: comp. ver. 6
ἐν ἀληθείᾳ. See also Gal. ii. 5, 14,
where a similar contrast is implied in
the use of ἡ ἀληθεία τοῦ εὐαγγελίου.</p>

<p class='c034'>6. τοῦ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς ‘<em>which
reached you</em>.’  The expression παρεῖναι
εἰς is not uncommon in classical
writers; comp. παρεῖναι πρὸς in Acts
xii. 20, Gal. iv. 18, 20. So also εὑρεθῆναι
εἰς (Acts viii. 40), γενέσθαι εἰς
(e.g. Acts xxv. 15), and even εἶναι
εἰς (Luke xi. 7).  See Winer § l. p.
516 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ] For a similar
hyperbole see Rom. i. 8 ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ
κόσμῳ; comp. 1 Thess. i. 8, 2 Cor. ii. 14,
ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ. More lurks under these
words than appears on the surface. The
true Gospel, the Apostle seems to say,
proclaims its truth by its universality.
The false gospels are the outgrowths
of local circumstances, of special idiosyncrasies;
the true Gospel is the
same everywhere. The false gospels
address themselves to limited circles;
the true Gospel proclaims itself boldly
throughout the world. Heresies are
at best ethnic: truth is essentially
catholic. See ver. 23 μὴ μετακινούμενοι

<a href='#Page_202'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>ἐστὶν καρποφορούμενον] ‘<em>is constantly
bearing fruit</em>.’ The fruit, which the
Gospel bears without fail in all soils
and under every climate, is its credential,
its verification, as against the
pretensions of spurious counterfeits.
The substantive verb should here be
taken with the participle, so as to
express <em>continuity</em> of present action;
as in 2 Cor. ix. 12 οὐ μόνον ἐστὶν προσαναπληροῦσα
κ.τ.λ., Phil. ii. 26 ἐπιποθῶν
ἦν. It is less common in St Paul
than in some of the Canonical writers,
e.g. St Mark and St Luke; but probably
only because he deals less in
narrative.</p>

<p class='c034'>Of the middle καρποφορεῖσθαι no
other instance has been found. The
voice is partially illustrated by κωδωνοφορεῖσθαι,
σιδηροφορεῖσθαι, τυμπανοφορεῖσθαι,
though, as involving a
different sense of -φορεῖσθαι ‘to wear,’
these words are not exact parallels.
Here the use of the middle is the
more marked, inasmuch as the active
occurs just below (ver. 10) in the
same connexion, καρποφοροῦντες καὶ
αὐξανόμενοι. This fact however points
to the force of the word here. The
middle is <em>intensive</em>, the active <em>extensive</em>.
The middle denotes the inherent
energy, the active the external diffusion.
The Gospel is essentially a reproductive
organism, a plant whose
‘seed is in itself.’ For this ‘dynamic’
middle see Moulton’s note on Winer
§ xxxviii. p. 319.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ αὐξανόμενον] The Gospel is not
like those plants which exhaust themselves
in bearing fruit and wither
away. The external growth keeps
pace with the reproductive energy.
While καρποφορούμενον describes the
inner working, αὐξανόμενον gives the
outward extension of the Gospel. The
words καὶ αὐξανόμενον are not found
in the received text, but the authority
in their favour is overwhelming.</p>

<p class='c034'>καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν The comparison
is thus doubled back, as it were, on
itself. This irregularity disappears in
the received text, καὶ ἐστὶν καρποφορούμενον
καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν, where the
insertion of καὶ before καρποφορούμενον
straightens the construction. For
a similar irregularity see 1 Thess. iv.
1 παρακαλοῦμεν ἐν Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ ἵνα,
καθὼς παρελάβετε παρ’ ἡμῶν τὸ πῶς δεῖ
ὑμᾶς περιπατεῖν καὶ ἀπέσκειν θεῷ, καθὼς
καὶ περιπατεῖτε, ἵνα περισσεῦητε μᾶλλον,
where again the received text simplifies
the construction, though in a different
way, by omitting the first ἵνα
and the words καθὼς καὶ περιπατεῖτε.
In both cases the explanation of the
irregularity is much the same; the
clause reciprocating the comparison
(here καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν, there καθὼς
καὶ περιπατεῖτε) is an afterthought
springing out of the Apostle’s anxiety
not to withhold praise where praise
can be given.</p>

<p class='c034'>For the appearance of καὶ in both
members of the comparison, καὶ ἐν
παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ ... καθὼς καὶ, comp.
Rom. i. 13 καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν καθὼς καὶ ἐν τοῖς
λοιποῖς ἕθνεσιν; and in the reversed
order below, iii. 13 καθὼς καὶ ὁ Κύριος
ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν, ὅυτως καὶ ὑμεῖς (with
the note): see also Winer liii. p. 549
(ed. Moulton). The correlation of the
clauses is thus rendered closer, and
the comparison emphasized.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἠκούσατε καὶ ἐπέγνωτε] The accusative
is governed by both verbs equally,
‘Ye were instructed in and fully apprehended
the grace of God.’ For
this sense of ἀκούειν see below, ver.
23. For ἐπιγινώσκειν as denoting ‘advanced
knowledge, thorough appreciation,’
see the note on ἐπίγνωσις, ver. 9.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ] St Paul’s synonyme
for the Gospel. In Acts xx. 24
he describes it as his mission to preach
τὸ εὐαγγελίοντης χάριτος τοῦ θεοῦ. The
true Gospel as taught by Epaphras was
an offer of free grace, a message from
God; the false gospel, as superposed
by the heretical teachers, was a code
of rigorous prohibitions, a system of
human devising. It was not χάρις but
δόγματα (ii. 14); not τοῦ θεοῦ but τοῦ
κόσμου, τῶυ ἀνθρώπων (ii. 8, 20, 22).
For God’s power and goodness it substituted
self-mortification and self-exaltation.
The Gospel is called ἡ χάρις
τοῦ θεοῦ again in 2 Cor. vi. 1, viii. 9,
with reference to the same leading
characteristic which the Apostle delights
to dwell upon (e.g. Rom. iii. 24,
v. 15, Eph. ii. 5, 8), and which he here
tacitly contrasts with the doctrine of the
later intruders. The false teachers of
Colossæ, like those of Galatia, would
lead their hearers ἀθετεῖν τὴν χάριν
τοῦ Θεοῦ (Gal. ii. 21); to accept their
doctrine was ἐκπίπτειν τῆς χάριτος
(Gal. v. 4).</p>

the preceding verse.</p>

<p class='c034'>Ἐπαφρᾶ] On the notices of Epaphras,
and on his work as the evangelist
of the Colossians, see above, p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a> sq.,
p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a> sq., and the note on iv. 12.</p>

<p class='c034'>συνδούλου] See iv. 7. The word

<p class='c034'>ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν] As the evangelist of
Colossæ, Epaphras had <em>represented</em>
St Paul there and preached in his
stead; see above, p. 30. The other
reading ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν might be interpreted
in two ways: either (1) It might
describe the personal ministrations of
Epaphras to St Paul as the representative
of the Colossians (see a similar
case in Phil. ii. 25, iv. 18), and so it
might be compared with Philem. 13
ἵνα ὑπὲρ σοῦ μοι διακονῇ; but this interpretation
is hardly consistent with
τοῦ Χριστοῦ. Or (2) It might refer to
the preaching of Epaphras for the
good of the Colossians; but the natural
construction in this case would
hardly be ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν (of which there is
no direct example), but either ὑμῶν
(Rom. xv. 8) or ὑμῖν (1 Pet. i. 12).
The balance of external authority
however is against it. Partly by
the accidental interchange of similar
sounds, partly by the recurrence of
ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν in the context (vv. 3, 9), and
partly also from ignorance of the historical
circumstances, ὑμῶν would readily
be substituted for ἡμῶν. See the
detached note on various readings.</p>

<p class='c033'>9–14. ‘Hearing then that ye thus
abound in works of faith and love, we
on our part have not ceased, from the
day when we received the happy
tidings, to pray on your behalf. And
this is the purport of our petitions;
that ye may grow more and more in
knowledge, till ye attain to the perfect
understanding of God’s will, being endowed
with all wisdom to apprehend
His verities and all intelligence to
follow His processes, living in the
mind of the Spirit—to the end that
knowledge may manifest itself in
practice, that your conduct in life may
be worthy of your profession in the
Lord, so as in all ways to win for you
the gracious favour of God your King.
Thus, while ye bear fruit in every
good work, ye will also grow as the
tree grows, being watered and refreshed
by this knowledge, as by the
dew of heaven: thus will ye be
strengthened in all strength, according
to that power which centres in and
spreads from His glorious manifestation
of Himself, and nerved to all
endurance under affliction and all
long-suffering under provocation, not
only without complaining, but even
with joy: thus finally (for this is the
crown of all), so rejoicing ye will pour
forth your thanksgiving to the Universal
Father, who prepared and fitted
us all—you and us alike—to take possession
of the portion which His goodness
has allotted to us among the
saints in the kingdom of light. Yea,
by a strong arm He rescued us from
the lawless tyranny of Darkness, removed
us from the land of our bondage,
and settled us as free citizens in our
new and glorious home, where His Son,
the offspring and the representative
of His love, is King; even the same,
who paid our ransom and thus procured
our redemption from captivity—our
redemption, which (be assured)
is nothing else than the remission of
our sins.’</p>

<p class='c034'>9. Διὰ τοῦτο] ‘<em>for this cause</em>,’ i.e.
‘by reason of your progressive faith
and love,’ referring not solely to ὁ καὶ
δηλώσας κ.τ.λ. but to the whole of
the preceding description. For διὰ
τοῦτο καὶ ἡμεῖς in an exactly similar
connexion, see 1 Thess. ii. 13; comp.
Ephes. i. 15 διὰ τοῦτο κἀγὼ κ.τ.λ. In
all these cases the καὶ denotes the
<em>response</em> of the Apostle’s personal
feeling to the favourable character
of the news; ‘we on our part.’ This
idea of correspondence is still further
emphasized by the repetition of the
same words: καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν ἀφ’ ἧς ἡμέρας
ἠκούσατε (ver. 6), καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀφ’ ἧς ἡμέρας
ἠκούσαμεν (ver. 9).</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ αἰτούμενοι] The words have an
exact parallel in Mark xi. 24 (as correctly
read) πάντα ὅσα προσεύχεσθε
καὶ αἰτεῖσθε.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἵνα] With words like προσεύχεσθαι,
αἰτεῖσθαι, etc., the earlier and stronger
force of ἵνα, implying <em>design</em>, glides
imperceptibly into its later and weaker
use, signifying merely <em>purport</em> or <em>result</em>,
so that the two are hardly separable,
unless one or other is directly
indicated by something in the context.
See the notes on Phil. i. 9, and
comp. Winer § xliv. p. 420 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν] A favourite word in the
later epistles of St Paul; see the note
on Phil. i. 9. In all the four epistles
of the first Roman captivity it is an
element in the Apostle’s opening prayer
for his correspondents’ well-being (Phil.
i. 9, Ephes. i. 17, Philem. 6, and here).
The greater stress which is thus laid on
the contemplative aspects of the Gospel
may be explained partly by St Paul’s
personal circumstances, partly by the
requirements of the Church. His enforced
retirement and comparative
leisure would lead his own thoughts
in this direction, while at the same
time the fresh dangers threatening the
truth from the side of mystic speculation
required to be confronted by
an exposition of the Gospel from a
corresponding point of view.</p>

<p class='c034'>The compound ἐπίγνωσις is an advance
upon γνῶσις, denoting a larger
and more thorough knowledge. So
Chrysostom here, ἔγνωτε, ἀλλὰ δεῖ τι
καὶ ἐπιγνῶναι. Comp. Justin Mart.
<cite>Dial.</cite> 3. p. 221 <span class='fss'>A</span>, ἡ παρέχουσα αὐτῶν

himself contrasts γινώσκειν, γνῶσις, with
ἐπιγινώσκειν, ἐπίγνωσις, as the partial
with the complete, in two passages,
Rom. i. 21, 38, 1 Cor. xiii. 12.
With this last passage (ἄρτι γινώσκω
ἐκ μέρους, τότε δὲ ἐπιγνώσομαι) compare

God and of Christ, as being the perfection
of knowledge: e.g. Prov. ii. 5,

(see Waitz on Arist. <cite>Organ.</cite> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p.
295 sq.), Cicero <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>de Off.</cite></span> i. 43 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘princeps
omnium virtutum,’</span> Clem. Alex.
<cite>Pæd.</cite> ii. 2, p. 181, τελεία ... ἐμπεριλαβοῦσα
τὰ ὅλα. The Stoic definition of
σοφία, as ἐπιστήμη θείων καὶ ἀνθρωπίνων
καὶ τῶν τούτων αἰτιῶν, is repeated
by various writers: e.g. Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Off.</cite></span>
ii. 5, Philo. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Congr. erud. grat.</cite></span> 14,

<cite>Pæd.</cite> ii. 2, p. 181, <cite>Strom.</cite> i. 5, p. 333,
Aristob. in Eus. <cite>Præp. Ev.</cite> xiii. 12
p. 667). And the glorification of σοφία
by heathen writers was even surpassed
by its apotheosis in the Proverbs
and in the Wisdom of Solomon.
While σοφία ‘wisdom’ is thus primary
and absolute (<cite>Eth. Nic.</cite> vi. 7 μὴ μόνον
τὰ ἐκ τῶν ἀρχῶν εἰδέναι ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ
τὰς ἀρχὰς ἀληθεύειν), both σύνεσις ‘intelligence’
and φρόνησις ‘prudence’
are derivative and special (<cite>Eth. Nic.</cite>
vi. 12 τῶν ἐσχάτων καὶ τῶν καθ’ ἕκαστον).
They are both applications of σοφία
to details, but they work on different
lines; for, while σύνεσις is critical,
φρόνησις is practical; while σύνεσις
apprehends the bearings of things,
φρόνησις suggests lines of action: see
Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eth. Nic.</cite></span> vi. 11 ἡ μὲν γὰρ φρόνησις
ἐπιτακτική ἐστιν ... ἡ δὲ σύνεσις
κριτική. For σύνεσις see 2 Tim.
ii. 7 &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>νόει</em>&nbsp; ὃ λέγω, δώσει γάρ σοι ὁ
Κύριος &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>σύνεσιν</em>&nbsp; ἐν πᾶσιν. This relation
of σοφία to σύνεσις explains why in
almost every case σοφία (σοφός) precedes
σύνεσις (συνετός), where they
are found together, and also why in
Baruch iii. 23 οἱ ἐκζητηταὶ τῆς συνέσεως,
ὁδὸν δὲ σοφίας οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, we
find σύνεσις implying a tentative, partial,
approach to σοφία. The relation
of σοφία to φρόνησις will be considered
more at length in the note on the
parallel passage, Ephes. i. 8.</p>

<p class='c034'>πνευματικῇ] The word is emphatic
from its position. The false teachers
also offered a σοφία, but it had only
a show of wisdom (ii. 23); it was an
empty counterfeit calling itself philosophy
(ii. 8); it was the offspring of
vanity nurtured by the mind of the <em>flesh</em>
(ii. 18). See 2 Cor. i. 12 οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ
σαρκικῇ, where a similar contrast is
implied, and 1 Cor. i. 20, ii. 5, 6, 13,
iii. 19, where it is directly expressed
by σοφία τοῦ κόσμου, σοφία ἀνθρώπων,
σοφία τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου, ἀνθρωπίνη σοφία,
etc.</p>

<p class='c034'>10. περιπατῆσαι ἀξίως κ.τ.λ.] So 1
Thess. ii. 12, Ephes. iv. i; comp. Phil.
i. 27. The infinitive here denotes the
consequence (not necessarily the purpose)
of the spiritual enlightenment
described in ἵνα πληρωθῆτε κ.τ.λ.; see
Winer § xliv. p. 399 sq. With the received
text &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τοῦ</em>&nbsp; περιπατῆσαι ὑμᾶς ἀξίως
κ.τ.λ. the connexion might be doubtful;
but this reading is condemned by external
evidence. The emphasis of the
sentence would be marred by the insertion
of ὑμᾶς. The end of all knowledge,
the Apostle would say, is conduct.</p>

<p class='c034'>τοῦ Κυρίου] i.e. ‘of Christ.’ In 1
Thess. ii. 12 indeed we have περιπατεῖν
ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ; but St Paul’s common,
and apparently universal, usage
requires us to understand ὁ Κύριος of
Christ.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀρέσκειαν] i.e. ‘to please <em>God</em> in all
ways’; comp. 1 Thess. iv. 1 πῶς δεῖ
ὑμᾶς περιπατεῖν καὶ αρέσκειν Θεῷ. As
this word was commonly used to describe
the proper attitude of men towards
God, the addition of τοῦ Θεοῦ
would not be necessary: Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quis
rer. div. her.</cite></span> 24 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 490) ὡς ἀποδεχομένου

quoted by Loesner. Otherwise it is
used especially of ingratiating oneself
with a sovereign or potentate, e.g.
Polyb. vi. 2. 12; and perhaps in the
higher connexion, in which it occurs
in the text, the idea of a king is still
prominent, as e.g. Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mund.
Op.</cite></span> 50 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 34) πάντα καὶ λέγειν καὶ
πράττειν ἐσπούδαζεν εἰς ἀρέσκειαν τοῦ

this complaisance is always dangerous
and most commonly vicious; hence
ἀρέσκεια is a bad quality in Aristotle
[?] (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eth. Eud.</cite></span> ii. 3 τὸ λίαν πρὸς ἡδονήν)
as also in Theophrastus (<cite>Char.</cite> 5 οὐκ
ἐπὶ τῷ βελτίστῳ ἡδονῆς παρασκευαστική),
but towards the King of kings no
obsequiousness can be excessive. The
ἀρέσκεια of Aristotle and Theophrastus
presents the same moral contrast to
the ἀρέσκεια here, as ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκειν
to Θεῷ ἀρέσκειν in such passages
as 1 Thess. ii. 4, Gal. i. 10. Opposed
to the ἀρέσκεια commended here is ἀνθρωπαρέσκεια
condemned below, iii. 22.</p>

<p class='c033'>τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ] The ‘glory’ here,
as frequently, stands for the majesty
or the power or the goodness of God,
as <em>manifested</em> to men; e.g. Eph. i. 6,
12, 17, iii. 16; comp. ver. 27, below.
The δόξα, the bright light over the
mercy-seat (Rom. ix. 4), was a symbol
of such manifestations. God’s revelation
of Himself to us, however this
revelation may be made, is the one
source of all our highest strength
(κατὰ τὸ κράτος κ.τ.λ.).</p>

<p class='c034'>ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν] ‘<em>endurance
and long-suffering</em>.’ The two words
occur in the same context in 2 Cor. vi.
4, 6, 2 Tim. iii. 10, James v. 10, 11,
Clem. Rom. 58, Ign. <cite>Ephes.</cite> 3. They
are distinguished in Trench <cite>Synon.</cite>
§ liii. p. 184 sq. The difference of
meaning is best seen in their opposites.
While ὑπομονὴ is the temper which
does not easily succumb under suffering,
μακροθυμία is the self-restraint
which does not hastily retaliate a
wrong. The one is opposed to <em>cowardice</em>
or <em>despondency</em>, the other to
<em>wrath</em> or <em>revenge</em> (Prov. xv. 18, xvi. 32;
see also the note on iii. 12). While
ὑπομονὴ is closely allied to <em>hope</em> (1
Thess. i. 3), μακροθυμία is commonly
connected with <em>mercy</em> (e.g. Exod. xxxiv.
6). This distinction however, though
it applies generally, is not true without
exception. Thus in Is. lvii. 15
μακροθυμία is opposed to ὀλιγοψυχία,
where we should rather have expected
ὑπομονή; and μακροθυμεῖν is used similarly
in James v. 7.</p>

<p class='c034'>μετὰ χαρᾶς] So James i. 2, 3, πᾶσαν
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>χαρὰν</em>&nbsp; ἡγήσασθε ... ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε
ποικίλοις, γινώσκοντες ὅτι τὸ
δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως κατεργάζεται
ὑπομονέν κ.τ.λ.: comp. 1 Pet. iv. 13,
and see below i. <a href='#I_24'>24</a>. This parallel
points to the proper connexion of
μετὰ χαρᾶς, which should be attached
to the preceding words. On the other
hand some would connect it with εὐχαριστοῦντες
for the sake of preserving
the balance of the three clauses, ἐν
παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ καρποφοροῦντες, ἐν
πάσῃ δυνάμει δυναμούμενοι, μετὰ χαρᾶς
εὐχαριστοῦντες; and this seems to be
favoured by Phil. i. 4 μετὰ χαρᾶς τὴν
δέησιν ποιούμενος: but when it is so
connected, the emphatic position of
μετὰ χαρᾶς cannot be explained; nor
indeed would these words be needed
at all, for εὐχαριστία is in itself an act
of rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c034'>12. εὐχαριστοῦντες] most naturally
coordinated with the preceding participles
and referred to the Colossians.
The duty of thanksgiving is more than
once enforced upon them below, ii. 7,
iii. 17, iv. 2; comp. 1 Thess. v. 18. On
the other hand the first person ἡμᾶς,
which follows, has led others to connect
εὐχαριστοῦντες with the primary
verb of the sentence, οὐ παυόμεθα ver.
9. But the sudden transition from
the second to the first person is quite
after St Paul’s manner (see the note
on ii. 13, 14, συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς ...
χαρισάμενος ἡμῖν), and cannot create
any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c033'>τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κλήρου] ‘<em>the parcel

genitive of apposition: see Winer § lix.
p. 666 sq., and comp. Ps. xv (xvi). 5

Acts viii. 21 μερὶς and κλῆρος are coordinated;
in Gen. xxxi. 14, Num.

The inheritance of Canaan, the
allotment of the promised land, here
presents an analogy to, and supplies
a metaphor for, the higher hopes of
the new dispensation, as in Heb. iii.
7-iv. 11. See also below, iii. 24 τὴν
ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆς κληρονομίας, and Ephes.
i. 18. St Chrysostom writes, διὰ τί

κατορθωμάτων οἰκείων βασιλείας τυγχάνει,
referring to Luke xvii. 10. It is
not won by us, but allotted to us.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν τῷ φωτί] best taken with the expression
τὴν μερίδα κ.τ.λ. For the
omission of the definite article, [τὴν]
ἐν τῷ φωτὶ, see above, vv. 2, 4, 8. The
portion of the saints is situated in the
kingdom of light. For the whole context
compare St Paul’s narrative in
Acts xxvi. 18 τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀπὸ

ideas and many of the expressions
recur. See also Acts xx. 32, in another
of St Paul’s later speeches. As a classical
parallel, Plato <cite>Resp.</cite> vii. p. 518 <span class='fss'>A</span>,
ἔκ τε φωτὸς εἰς σκότος μεθισταμένων
καὶ ἐκ σκότους εἰς φῶς, is quoted.</p>

<p class='c034'>13. ‘We were slaves in the land of
darkness. God rescued us from this
thraldom. He transplanted us thence,
and settled us as free colonists and
citizens in the kingdom of His Son, in
the realms of light.’</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐρύσατο] ‘<em>rescued, delivered us</em>’ by
His strong arm, as a mighty conqueror:
comp. ii. 15 θριαμβεύσας. On the
form ἐρύσατο see A. Buttmann, p. 29:
comp. Clem. Rom. 55, and see the
note on ἐξερίζωσεν, <em>ib.</em> 6.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐξουσίας] here ‘arbitrary power, tyranny.’
The word ἐξουσία properly signifies
‘liberty of action’ (ἔξεστι), and
thence, like the corresponding English
word ‘license,’ invokes two secondary
ideas, of which either may be so
prominent as to eclipse the other;
(1) ‘authority,’ ‘<em>delegated</em> power’ (e.g.
Luke xx. 2); or (2) ‘tyranny,’ ‘lawlessness,’
‘<em>unrestrained</em> or <em>arbitrary</em>
power.’ For this second sense comp.
e.g. Demosth. <cite>F.L.</cite> p. 428 τὴν ἄγαν
ταύτην ἐξουσίαν, Xenoph. <cite>Hiero</cite> 5
τῆς εἰς τὸ παρὸν ἐξουσίας ἕνεκα (speaking
of tyrants), Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit. Eum.</cite></span> 13 ἀνάγωγοι

καὶ τὸν ὄγκον τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου δυνάμεως,
Herodian ii. 4 καθαίρεσιν τῆς ἀνέτου
ἐξουσίας. This latter idea of a capricious
unruly rule is prominent here.
The expression ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους
occurs also in Luke xxii. 53, where
again the idea of disorder is involved.
The transference from darkness to
light is here represented as a transference
from an arbitrary tyranny, an
ἐξουσία, to a well-ordered sovereignty,
a βασιλεία. This seems also to be
St Chrysostom’s idea; for he explains
τῆς ἐξουσίας by τῆς τυραννίδος, adding
χαλεπὸν καὶ τὸ ἀπλῶς εἶναι ὑπὸ τῷ διαβόλῳ·
τὸ δὲ καὶ μετ’ ἐξουσίας, τοῦτο

<p class='c034'>μετέστησεν] ‘<em>removed</em>,’ when they
were baptized, when they accepted
Christ. The image of μετέστησεν is
supplied by the wholesale transportation
of peoples (ἀναστάτους or ἀνασπάστους
ποιεῖν), of which the history
of oriental monarchies supplied so
many examples.   See Joseph. <cite>Ant.</cite> ix.
11. 1 τοὺς οἰκήτορας αἰχμαλωτίσας

<p class='c033'>τοῦ υἱοῦ] Not of inferior angels, as
the false teachers would have it (ii. 18),
but of His own Son. The same contrast
between a dispensation of angels
and a dispensation of the Son underlies
the words here, which is explicitly
brought out in Heb. i. 1-ii. 8;
see especially i. 2 ἐλάλησεν ἡμῖν ἐν υἱῷ,
compared with ii. 5 οὐ γὰρ ἀγγέλοις
ὑπέταξεν τὴν οἰκουμένην τὴν μέλλουσαν.
Severianus has rightly caught the idea
underlying τοῦ υἱοῦ here; ὑπὸ τὸν
κληρονόμον ἐσμέν, οὐχ ὑπὸ τοὺς οἰκέτας.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ]  ‘<em>of His love</em>.’ As
love is the essence of the Father (1 Joh.
iv. 8, 16), so is it also of the Son. The
mission of the Son is the revelation of
the Father’s love; for as He is the
μονογενής, the Father’s love is perfectly
represented in Him (see 1 Joh.
iv. 9). St Augustine has rightly interpreted
St Paul’s words here, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Trin.</cite></span> XV. 19 (VIII. p. 993) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Caritas
quippe Patris ... nihil est quam ejus
ipsa natura atque substantia ... ac per
hoc filius caritatis ejus nullus est alius
quam qui de ejus substantia est genitus.’</span>
Thus these words are intimately
connected with the expressions which
follow, εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου (ver.
15), and ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα
κατοικῆσαι (ver. 19). The loose
interpretation, which makes τοῦ υἱοῦ
τῆς ἀγάπης equivalent to τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ
ἠγαπημένου, destroys the whole force
of the expression.</p>

<p class='c034'>In the preceding verses we have a
striking illustration of St Paul’s teaching
in two important respects. <em>First.</em>
The reign of Christ has already begun.
His kingdom is a present kingdom.
Whatever therefore is <em>essential</em> in the
kingdom of Christ must be capable of
realisation now. There may be some
exceptional manifestation in the world
to come, but this cannot alter its inherent
character. In other words the
sovereignty of Christ is essentially a
moral and spiritual sovereignty, which
has begun now and will only be perfected
hereafter. <em>Secondly.</em> Corresponding
to this, and equally significant,
is his language in speaking of
individual Christians. He regards
them as already rescued from the
power of darkness, as already put in
possession of their inheritance as
saints. They are <em>potentially</em> saved,
because the knowledge of God is itself
salvation, and this knowledge is within
their reach. Such is St Paul’s constant
mode of speaking. He uses the
language not of exclusion, but of comprehension.
He prefers to dwell on
their potential advantages, rather than
on their actual attainments. He hopes
to make them saints by dwelling on
their calling as saints. See especially
Ephes. ii. 6 συνήγειρεν καὶ συνεκάθισεν

who releases him by the payment of a
ransom. The clause which follows in

<p class='c034'>τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν]  So in the
parallel passage Ephes. i. 7 the Apostle
defines τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν as τὴν
ἄφεσιν τῶν παραπτωμάτων.  May not
this studied precision point to some
false conception of ἀπολύτρωσις put
forward by the heretical teachers?
Later Gnostics certainly perverted the
meaning of the term, applying it to
their own formularies of initiation.
This is related of the Marcosians by
Irenæus i. 13. 6 διὰ τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν
ἀκρατήτους καὶ ἀοράτους γίνεσθαι τῷ
κριτῇ κ.τ.λ., i. 21. 1 ὅσοι γάρ εἰσι
ταύτης τῆς γνώμης μυσταγωγοί, τοσαῦται
καὶ ἀπολυτρώσεις, <cite>ib.</cite> § 4 εἶναι δὲ
τελείαν ἀπολύτρωσιν αὐτὴν τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν
τοῦ ἀρρήτου μεγέθους (with the
whole context), and Hippolytus <cite>Hær.</cite>
vi. 41 λέγουσί τι φωνῇ ἀρρήτῳ, ἐπιτιθέντες
χεῖρα τῷ τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν λαβόντι
κ.τ.λ. (comp. ix. 13). In support
of their nomenclature they perverted
such passages as the text, Iren.
i. 21. 2 τὸν Παῦλον ῥητῶς φάσκουσι
τὴν ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ἀπολύτρωσιν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>πολλάκις</em>&nbsp;
μεμηνυκέναι. It seems not improbable
that the communication of
similar mystical secrets, perhaps connected
with their angelology (ii. 18),
was put forward by these Colossian
false teachers as an ἀπολύτρωσις. Compare
the words in the baptismal formula
of the Marcosians as given in
Iren. i. 21. 3 (comp. Theodt. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hær.
Fab.</cite></span> i. 9) εἰς ἕνωσιν καὶ ἀπολύτρωσιν
καὶ κοινωνίαν τῶν δυνάμεων, where the
last words (which have been differently
interpreted) must surely mean
‘communion with the (spiritual) powers.’
Thus it is a parallel to εἰς λύτρωσιν
ἀγγελικήν, which appears in an alternative
formula of these heretics given
likewise by Irenæus in the context;
for this latter is explained in Clem.
Alex. <cite>Exc. Theod.</cite> p. 974, εἰς λύτρωσιν
ἀγγελικήν, τουτέστιν, ἣν καὶ ἄγγελοι
ἔχουσιν. Any direct historical connexion
between the Colossian heretics
and these later Gnostics of the Valentinian
school is very improbable; but
the passages quoted will serve to show
how a false idea of ἀπολύτρωσις would
naturally be associated with an esoteric
doctrine of angelic powers. See
the note on i. 28 ἵνα παραστήσωμεν
πάντα ἄνθρωπον τέλειον.</p>

<p class='c033'><a href='#I_15'>15</a> sq. In the passage which follows
St Paul defines the Person of
Christ, claiming for Him the absolute
supremacy,</p>

<p class='c036'>(1) In relation to the <em>Universe</em>, the
<em>Natural</em> Creation (vv. 15–17);</p>

<p class='c036'>(2) In relation to the  <em>Church</em>, the
new <em>Moral</em> Creation (ver. 18);</p>

<p class='c034'>and he then combines the two, ἵνα
γένηται &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐν πᾶσιν</em>&nbsp; αὐτὸς πρωτεύων, explaining
this twofold sovereignty by the
absolute indwelling of the <em>pleroma</em> in
Christ, and showing how, as a consequence,
the reconciliation and harmony
of all things must be effected
in Him (vv. 19, 20).</p>

<p class='c034'>As the idea of the <em>Logos</em> underlies
the whole of this passage, though the
term itself does not appear, a few
words explanatory of this term will be
necessary by way of preface. The
word λόγος then, denoting both ‘reason’
and ‘speech,’ was a philosophical
term adopted by Alexandrian Judaism
before St Paul wrote, to express
the <em>manifestation</em> of the Unseen God,
the Absolute Being, in the creation
and government of the World. It
included all modes by which God
makes himself known to man. As
His <em>reason</em>, it denoted His purpose
or design; as His <em>speech</em>, it implied
His revelation. Whether this λόγος
was conceived merely as the divine
energy personified, or whether the
conception took a more concrete form,
I need not stop now to enquire. A
fuller account of the matter will be
found in the dissertation at the end
of this volume. It is sufficient for the
understanding of what follows to say
that Christian teachers, when they
adopted this term, exalted and fixed
its meaning by attaching to it two
precise and definite ideas: (1) ‘The
Word is a Divine Person,’ ὁ λόγος ἦν
πρὸς τὸν Θεόν καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος;
and (2) ‘The Word became incarnate
in Jesus Christ,’ ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο. It
is obvious that these two propositions
must have altered materially the significance
of all the subordinate terms
connected with the idea of the λόγος;
and that therefore their use in Alexandrian
writers, such as Philo, cannot
be taken to <em>define</em>, though it may be
brought to <em>illustrate</em>, their meaning
in St Paul and St John. With these
cautions the Alexandrian phraseology,
as a providential preparation for the
teaching of the Gospel, will afford important
aid in the understanding of
the Apostolic writings.</p>

<p class='c034'><a href='#I_15'>15–17.</a> ‘He is the perfect image,
the visible representation, of the unseen
God. He is the Firstborn, the
absolute Heir of the Father, begotten
before the ages; the Lord of the
Universe by virtue of primogeniture,
and by virtue also of creative agency.
For in and through Him the whole
world was created, things in heaven
and things on earth, things visible
to the outward eye and things cognisable
by the inward perception. His
supremacy is absolute and universal.
All powers in heaven and earth are
subject to Him. This subjection extends
even to the most exalted and
most potent of angelic beings, whether
they be called Thrones or Dominations
or Princedoms or Powers, or
whatever title of dignity men may
confer upon them. Yes: He is first
and He is last.   Through Him, as the
mediatorial Word, the universe has
been created; and unto Him, as the
final goal, it is tending. In Him is
no before or after. He is pre-existent
and self-existent before all the worlds.
And in Him, as the binding and sustaining
power, universal nature coheres
and consists.’</p>

<p class='c034'>15. ὅς ἐστιν κ.τ.λ.] The Person of
Christ is described <em>first</em> in relation
more especially to Deity, as εἰκὼν τοῦ
Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου, and <em>secondly</em> in relation
more especially to created
things, as πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως.
The fundamental conception of the
Logos involves the idea of <em>mediation</em>
between God and creation. A perverted
view respecting the nature of
the mediation between the two lay,
as we have seen, at the root of the
heretical teaching at Colossæ (p. 34,
p. 101 sq., p. 181 sq.), and required to
be met by the true doctrine of Christ
as the Eternal Logos.</p>

Philo made of the text Gen. i. 26, 27,
κατ’ εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν, κατ’ εἰκόνα Θεοῦ,
see the note on iii. 10. Still earlier
than Philo, before the idea of the λόγος
had assumed such a definite form,
the term was used of the Divine σοφία
personified in Wisd. vii. 26 ἀπαύγασμα
γάρ ἐστι φωτὸς ἀϊδίου ... καὶ εἰκὼν τῆς
ἀγαθότητος αὐτοῦ. St Paul himself
applies the term to our Lord in an
earlier epistle, 2 Cor. iv. 4 τῆς δόξης
τοῦ Χριστοῦ ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ
(comp. iii. 18 τὴν αὐτὴνεἰκόνα μεταμορφούμεθα).
Closely allied to εὶκὼν
also is χαρακτήρ, which appears in the
same connexion in Heb. i. 3 ὢν ἀπαύγασμα
τῆς δόξης καὶ χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως
αὐτοῦ, a passage illustrated
by Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Plant.</cite></span> 5 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 332) σφραγῖδι

<p class='c034'>Beyond the very obvious notion of
<em>likeness</em>, the word εἰκών involves two
other ideas;</p>

<p class='c034'>(1) <em>Representation.</em> In this respect
it is allied to χαρακτήρ, and differs
from (ομοίωμα. In ὁμοίωμα the
resemblance may be accidental, as
one egg is like another; but εἱκών
implies an archetype of which it is a
<em>copy</em>, as Greg. Naz. <cite>Orat.</cite> 30 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 554)
says ἅυτη γὰρ εἰκόνος φύσις &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>μίμημα</em>&nbsp;
εἶναι τοῦ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀρχετύπου</em>&nbsp;. So too Io. Damasc.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Imag.</cite></span> i. 9 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 311) εἰκών
ἐστιν ὁμοίωμα &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>χαρακτηρίζον</em>&nbsp; τὸ

Op. 23</cite></span> (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 16). On this difference
see Trench <cite>N. T. Synon.</cite> § xv. p. 47.
The εἰκὼν might be the result of direct
imitation (μιμητική) like the head of
a sovereign on a coin, or it might be
due to natural causes (φυσική) like
the parental features in the child,
but in any case it was <em>derived</em> from
its prototype: see Basil. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Spir.
Sanct.</cite></span> 18 § 45 (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 38). The word
itself however does not necessarily
imply <em>perfect</em> representation. Thus
man is said to be the image of God;
1 Cor. xi. 7 εἰκὼν καὶ δόξα Θεοῦ ὑπάρχων,
Clem. Rom. 33 ἄνθρωπον ... τῆς
ἑαυτοῦ εἰκόνος χαρακτῆρα. Thus again
an early Judæo-Christian writer so
designates the duly appointed bishop,
as the representative of the divine authority;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> iii. 62 ὡς εἰκόνα
Θεοῦ προτιμῶντας. The idea of <em>perfection</em>
does not lie in the word itself,
but must be sought from the context
(e.g. πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα ver. 19). The
use which was made of this expression,
and especially of this passage, in the
Christological controversies of the
fourth and fifth centuries may be seen
from the patristic quotations in Petav.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Theol. Dogm.</cite></span> de Trin. ii. 11. 9 sq.,
vi. 5. 6.</p>

<p class='c034'>(2) <em>Manifestation.</em> This idea comes
from the implied contrast to τοῦ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀοράτου</em>&nbsp;
Θεοῦ. St Chrysostom indeed
maintains the direct opposite, arguing
that, as the archetype is invisible, so
the image must be invisible also, ἡ
τοῦ ἀοράτου εἰκὼν καὶ αὐτὴ ἀόρατος καὶ
ὁμοίως ἀόρατος. So too Hilary <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c.
Const. Imp.</cite></span> 21 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 378) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ut imago
invisibilis Dei, etiam per id quod ipse
invisibilis est, invisibilis Dei imago
esset.’</span> And this was the view of the
Nicene and post-Nicene fathers generally.
But the underlying idea of the
εἰκών, and indeed of the λόγος generally,
is the manifestation of the hidden:
comp. Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Vit. Moys.</cite></span> ii. 12
(<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 144) εἰκὼν τῆς ἀοράτου φύσεως
ἐμφανής. And adopted into Christian
theology, the doctrine of the λόγος
expresses this conception still more
prominently by reason of the Incarnation;
comp. Tertull. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Marc.</cite></span> v. 19
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Scientes filium semper retro visum, si
quibus visus est in Dei nomine, ut

§ 12, 13, Orig. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Ioann.</cite></span> vi. § 2 (<span class='fss'>IV.</span>
p. 104). Among the post-Nicene fathers
too St Basil has caught the right
idea, <cite>Epist.</cite> xxxviii. 8 (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 121) ὁ
τῆς εἰκόνος κατανοήσας κάλλος ἐν περινοίᾳ
τοῦ ἀρχετύπου γίνεται ... βλέπειν διὰ
τούτου ἐκεῖνον ... τὸ ἀγέννητον κάλλος ἐν
τῷ γεννητῷ κατοπτεύσας. The Word,
whether pre-incarnate or incarnate,
is the revelation of the unseen Father:
comp. John i. 18 Θεὸν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>οὐδεὶς ἑώρακεν</em>&nbsp;
πώποτε· μονογενὴς Θεός, ὁ ὢν εἰς
τὸν κόλπον τοῦ πατρός, ἐκεῖνος &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐξηγήσατο</em>&nbsp;,
xiv. 9, 10 &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ὁ ἑωράκως ἐμὲ ἑώρακέν

&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>Δεῖξον</em>&nbsp; ἡμῖν τὸν πατέρα; (compared
with vi. 46 οὐχ ὅτι τὸν πατέρα ἑώρακέν
τις κ.τ.λ.). The epithet ἀοράτου however
must not be confined to the apprehension
of the bodily senses, but
will include the cognisance of the inward
eye also.</p>

<p class='c034'>πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως] ‘<em>the
First-born of all creation</em>.’ The word
πρωτότοκος has a twofold parentage:</p>

<p class='c034'>(1) Like εἰκών it is closely connected
with and taken from the Alexandrian
vocabulary of the Logos. The
word however which Philo applies to
the λόγος is not πρωτότοκος but πρωτόγονος:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Agric.</cite></span> 12 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 308) προστησάμενος
τὸν ὀρθὸν αὐτοῦ λόγον πρωτόγονον
ὑίον, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Somn.</cite></span> i. 37 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 653)
ὁ πρωτόγονος αὐτοῦ θεῖος λόγος, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Confus. ling.</cite></span> i. 28 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 427) σπουδαζέτω
κοσμεῖσθαι κατὰ τὸν πρωτόγονον
αὐτοῦ λόγον: comp. <cite>ib.</cite> i. 14 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 414)
τοῦτον πρεσβύτατον υἱὸν ὁ τῶν ὄντων
ἀνέτειλε πατήρ, ὃν ἑτέρωθι πρωτόγονον
ὠνόμασε: and this designation πρεσβύτατος
υἱὸς is several times applied
to the λόγος. Again in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quis rer. div.
her.</cite></span> § 24 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 489) the language of
Exod. xiii. 2 ἁγίασόν μοι πᾶν πρωτότοκον
πρωτογενές κ.τ.λ. is so interpreted
as to apply to the Divine Word. These
appellations, ‘the first-begotten, the
eldest son,’ are given to the Logos by
Philo, because in his philosophy it
includes the original conception, the
archetypal idea, of creation, which
was afterwards realised in the material
world. Among the early Christian
fathers Justin Martyr again and
again recognises the application of the
term πρωτότοκος to the Word; <cite>Apol.</cite>
i. 23 (p. 68) λόγος αὐτοῦ ὑπάρχων καὶ
πρωτότοκος καὶ δύναμις, <em>ib.</em> § 46 (p. 83)
τὸν Χριστὸν πρωτότοκον τοῦ Θεοῦ εἶναι
... λόγον ὄντα οὗ πᾶν γένος ἀνθρώπων
μετέσχε, <em>ib.</em> § 33 (p. 75 <span class='fss'>C</span>) τὸν λόγον ὃς
καὶ πρωτότοκος τῷ Θεῷ ἐστι. So too
Theophilus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad Antol.</cite></span> ii. 22 τοῦτον τὸν
λόγον ἐγέννησεν προφορικόν, πρωτότοκον
πάσης κτίσεως.</p>

<p class='c034'>(2) The word πρωτότοκος had also
another not less important link of
connexion with the past. The Messianic
reference of Ps. lxxxix. 28, ἐγὼ
πρωτότοκον θήσομαι αὐτὸν κ.τ.λ., seems
to have been generally allowed. So
at least it is interpreted by R. Nathan
in <cite>Shemoth Rabba</cite> 19, fol. 118. 4, ‘God
said, As I made Jacob a first-born
(Exod. iv. 22), so also will I make
king Messiah a first-born (Ps. lxxxix.
28).’ Hence ‘the first-born’ ὁ πρωτότοκος
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בכור</span>), used absolutely, became
a recognised title of Messiah. The
way had been paved for this Messianic
reference of πρωτότοκος by its prior
application to the Israelites, as the
prerogative race, Exod. iv. 22 ‘Israel
is my son, my first-born’: comp. Psalm.
Salom. xviii. 4   ἡ παιδεία σου ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς
ὡς υἱὸν πρωτότοκον μονογενῆ, 4 Esdr. vi.
58 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘nos populus tuus, quem vocasti
primogenitum, unigenitum,’</span> where the
combination of the two titles applied
in the New Testament to the Son is
striking. Here, as elsewhere (see the
note on Gal. iii. 16  καὶ τοῖς σπέρμασιν
κ.τ.λ.), the terms are transferred from
the race to the Messiah, as the representative,
the embodiment, of the race.</p>

<p class='c034'>As the Person of Christ was the
Divine response alike to the philosophical
questionings of the Alexandrian
Jew and to the patriotic hopes
of the Palestinian, these two currents
of thought meet in the term πρωτότοκος
as applied to our Lord, who is
both the true Logos and the true
Messiah. For this reason, we may
suppose, as well as for others, the
Christian Apostles preferred πρωτότοκος
to πρωτόγονος, which (as we may
infer from Philo) was the favourite
term with the Alexandrians, because
the former alone would include the
Messianic reference as well.</p>

<p class='c034'>The main ideas then which the word
involves are twofold; the one more
directly connected with the Alexandrian
conception of the Logos, the
other more nearly allied to the Palestinian
conception of the Messiah.</p>

<p class='c034'>(1) <em>Priority</em> to all creation. In
other words it declares the absolute
pre-existence of the Son. At first
sight it might seem that Christ is
here regarded as one, though the
earliest, of created things.  This interpretation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>however is not required
by the expression itself. The fathers
of the fourth century rightly called
attention to the fact that the Apostle
writes not πρωτόκτιστος, but πρωτότοκος;
e.g. Basil, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Eunom.</cite></span> iv (p. <span class='fss'>I.</span>
p. 292). Much earlier, in Clem. Alex.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Exc. Theod.</cite></span> 10 (p. 970), though without
any direct reference to this passage,
the μονογενὴς καὶ πρωτότοκος is
contrasted with the πρωτόκτιστοι, the
highest order of angelic beings; and
the word πρωτόκτιστος occurs more
than once elsewhere in his writings (e.g.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> v. 14, p. 699). Nor again does
the genitive case necessarily imply that
the πρωτότοκος Himself belonged to
the κτίσις, as will be shown presently.
And if this sense is not required by the
words themselves, it is directly excluded
by the context. It is inconsistent
alike with the universal agency in
creation which is ascribed to Him in
the words following, ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη
τὰ πάντα, and with the absolute pre-existence
and self-existence which is
claimed for Him just below, αὐτὸς
ἔστιν πρὸ πάντων. We may add also
that it is irreconcileable with other
passages in the Apostolic writings,
while it contradicts the fundamental
idea of the Christian consciousness.
More especially the description πρωτότοκος
πάσης κτίσεως must be interpreted
in such a way that it is not inconsistent
with His other title of μονογενής,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>unicus</em></span>, alone of His kind and
therefore distinct from created things.
The two words express the same
eternal fact; but while μονογενής
states it in itself, πρωτότοκος places it
in relation to the Universe. The
correct interpretation is supplied by
Justin Martyr, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial.</cite></span> § 100 (p. 326
<span class='fss'>D</span>) πρωτότοκον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ πρὸ πάντων
τῶν  κτισμάτων. He does not
indeed mention this passage, but it
was doubtless in his mind, for he elsewhere
uses the very expression πρωτότοκος
πάσης κτίσεως, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial.</cite></span> § 85
(p. 311 <span class='fss'>B</span>), § 138 (p. 367 <span class='fss'>D</span>); comp. also
§ 84 (p. 310 <span class='fss'>B</span>), where the words πρωτότοκος
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>τῶν πάντων ποιημάτων occur.</p>

<p class='c034'>(2) <em>Sovereignty</em> over all creation.
God’s ‘first-born’ is the natural ruler,
the acknowledged head, of God’s
household. The right of primogeniture
appertains to Messiah over all
created things. Thus in Ps. lxxxix.
28 after πρωτότοκον θήσομαι αὐτὸν
the explanation is added, ὑψηλὸν
παρὰ τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν τῆς γῆς, i.e. (as
the original implies) ‘above all the
kings of the earth.’ In its Messianic
reference this secondary idea of
sovereignty predominated in the word
πρωτότοκος, so that from this point of
view πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως would
mean ‘Sovereign Lord over all creation
by virtue of primogeniture.’ The
ἔθηκεν κληρόνομον πάντων of the Apostolic
writer (Heb. i. 2) exactly corresponds
to the θήσομαι πρωτότοκον
of the Psalmist (lxxxix. 28), and
doubtless was tacitly intended as a
paraphrase and application of this
Messianic passage. So again in Heb.
xii. 23, ἐκκλησίᾳ πρωτοτόκων, the most
probable explanation of the word is
that which makes it equivalent to
‘heirs of the kingdom,’ all faithful
Christians being <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ipso facto</em></span> πρωτότοκοι,
because all are kings. Nay, so completely
might this idea of dominion by
virtue of priority eclipse the primary
sense of the term ‘first-born’ in some
of its uses, that it is given as a title to
God Himself by R. Bechai on the Pentateuch,
fol. 124. 4, ‘Who is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>primogenitus
mundi</em></span>,’ <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">שהוא בכורי של עולם</span>,
i.e. ὅς ἐστιν πρωτότοκος τοῦ κόσμου, as
it would be rendered in Greek. In this
same work again, fol. 74. 4, Exod. xiii.
2 is falsely interpreted so that God is
represented as calling Himself <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘primogenitus’</span>:
see Schöttgen p. 922.
For other instances of secondary uses
of <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">בכור</span> in the Old Testament, where
the idea of ‘priority of birth’ is over-shadowed
by and lost in the idea of
‘pre-eminence,’ see Job xviii. 13 ‘the
first-born of death,’ Is. xiv. 30 ‘the
first-born of the poor’.</p>

<p class='c034'>πάσης κτίσεως ‘<em>of all creation</em>,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>rather than ‘<em>of every created thing</em>.’
The three senses of κτίσις in the New
Testament; are (1) creation, as the
act of creating, e.g. Rom. i. 20 ἀπὸ
κτίσεως κόσμου: (2) creation, as the
aggregate of created things, Mark xiii.
19 ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως ἣν ἔκτισεν ὁ Θεός
(where the parallel passage, Matt.
xxiv. 21, has ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς κόσμου), Rom.
viii. 22 πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις συστενάζει: (3)
a creation, a single created thing, a
creature, e.g. Rom. viii. 39 οὔτε τις
κτίσις ἑτέρα, Heb. iv. 13 οὐκ ἔστιν
κτίσις ἀφανής. As κτίσις without the
definite article is sometimes used of
the created world generally (e.g. Mark
xiii. 19), and indeed belongs to the
category of anarthrous nouns like
κόσμος, γῆ, οὐρανός, etc. (see Winer
§ xix. p. 149 sq.), it is best taken so
here. Indeed πάσης κτίσεως, in the
sense of πάντος κτίσματος, would be
awkward in this connexion; for πρωτότοκος
seems to require either a collective
noun, or a plural πασῶν τῶν
κτίσεων. In ver. 23 the case is different
(see the note there). The anarthrous
πᾶσα κτίσις is found in Judith
ix. 12 βασιλεῦ πασῆς κτίσεώς σου,
while πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις occurs in Judith
xvi. 14, Mark xvi. 15, Rom. viii. 22,
Clem. Rom. 19, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mart. Polyc.</cite></span> 14. For
πᾶς, signifying ‘<em>all</em>,’ and not ‘<em>every</em>,’
when attached to this class of nouns,
see Winer § xviii. p. 137.</p>

<p class='c034'>The genitive case must be interpreted
so as to include the full meaning
of πρωτότοκος, as already explained.
It will therefore signify:
‘He stands in the relation of πρωτότοκος
to all creation,’ i.e. ‘He is the
Firstborn, and, as the Firstborn, the
absolute Heir and sovereign Lord, of
all creation.’ The connexion is the
same as in the passage of R. Bechai
already quoted, where God is called
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>primogenitus mundi</em></span>. Another explanation
which would connect the
genitive with the first part of the compound
alone (πρωτό-), comparing Joh.
i. 15, 30, πρῶτός μου ἦν, unduly strains
the grammar, while it excludes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>idea of ‘heirship, sovereignty.’</p>

<p class='c034'>The history of the patristic exegesis
of this expression is not without a painful
interest. All the fathers of the
second and third centuries without
exception, so far as I have noticed,
correctly refer it to the Eternal
Word and not to the Incarnate Christ,
to the Deity and not to the humanity
of our Lord. So Justin <em>l.c.</em>,
Theophilus <em>l.c.</em>, Clement of Alexandria
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Exc. Theod.</cite></span> 7, 8, 19 (pp. 967,

Marc.</cite></span> v. 19, Hippolytus <cite>Hær.</cite> x. 33,
Origen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Cels.</cite></span> vi. 47, 63, 64, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Ioann.</cite></span>
i. § 22 (<span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 21), xix. § 5 (p. 305),
xxviii. § 14 (p. 392), Cyprian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Test.</cite></span>
ii. 1, Novatian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> 16, and
the Synod of Antioch (Routh’s <cite>Rel.
Sacr.</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span> pp. 290, 293). The Arian
controversy however gave a different
turn to the exegesis of the
passage. The Arians fastened upon
the expression πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως,
and drew from it the inference
that the Son was a created being.
The great use which they made of
the text appears from the document
in Hilary, <cite>Fragm. Hist.</cite> Op. <span class='fss'>II.</span> p.
644. The right answer to this false
interpretation we have already seen.
Many orthodox fathers however, not
satisfied with this, transferred the
expression into a new sphere, and
maintained that πρωτότοκος πάσης
κτίσεως describes the Incarnate Christ.
By so doing they thought to cut up
the Arian argument by the roots. As
a consequence of this interpretation,
they were obliged to understand the
κτίσις and the κτίζεσθαι in the context
of the new spiritual creation, the
καινὴ κτίσις of 2 Cor. v. 17, Gal. vi. 15.
Thus interpreted, πρωτότοκος πάσης
κτίσεως here becomes nearly equivalent
to πρωτότοκος ἐν πολλοῖς ἀδελφοῖς
in Rom. viii. 29. The arguments alleged
in favour of this interpretation
are mainly twofold: (1) That, if applied
to the Divine nature, πρωτότοκος
would contradict μονογενὴς which elsewhere
describes the nature of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Eternal Son. But those who maintained,
and rightly maintained, that
πρωτότοκος (Luke ii. 7) did not necessarily
imply that the Lord’s mother
had other sons, ought not to have
been led away by this fallacy. (2) That
πρωτότοκος in other passages (e.g.
Rom. viii. 29, Rev. i. 5, and just below,
ver. 18) is applied to the humanity
of Christ. But elsewhere, in
Heb. i. 6 ὅταν δὲ πάλιν εἰσαγάγῃ τὸν
πρωτότοκον κ.τ.λ., the term must almost
necessarily refer to the pre-existence
of the Son; and moreover
the very point of the Apostle’s language
in the text (as will be seen presently)
is the parallelism in the two
relations of our Lord—His relation to
the natural creation, as the Eternal
Word, and His relation to the spiritual
creation, as the Head of the Church—so
that the same word (πρωτότοκος
πάσης κτίσεως ver. 15, πρωτότοκος ἐκ
τῶν νεκρῶν ver. 18) is studiously used of
both. A false exegesis is sure to bring a
nemesis on itself. Logical consistency
required that this interpretation should
be carried farther; and Marcellus, who
was never deterred by any considerations
of prudence, took this bold step.
He extended the principle to the
whole context, including even εὶκὼν
τοῦ ἀοράτου Θεοῦ, which likewise he
interpreted of our Lord’s humanity.
In this way a most important Christological
passage was transferred into
an alien sphere; and the strongest
argument against Arianism melted
away in the attempt to combat Arianism
on false grounds. The criticisms
of Eusebius on Marcellus are perfectly
just: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eccl. Theol.</cite></span> i. 20 (p. 96) ταῦτα
περὶ τῆς θεότητος τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ,
κἂν μὴ Μαρκέλλῳ δοκῇ, εἴρηται· οὐ γὰρ
ἂν περὶ τῆς σαρκὸς ἂν εἶπεν τοσαῦτα ὁ
θεῖος ἀπόστολος κ.τ.λ.; comp. <em>ib.</em> ii. 9

1 (p. 6), i. 2 (p. 12), ii. 3 (pp. 43,
46 sq., 48). The objections to this
interpretation are threefold: (1) It
disregards the history of the terms
in their connexion with the pre-Christian
speculations of Alexandrian
Judaism. These however, though directly
or indirectly they were present
to the minds of the earlier fathers
and kept them in the right exegetical
path, might very easily have escaped
a writer in the fourth century. (2) It
shatters the context. To suppose
that such expressions as ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη
τὰ πάντα [τὰ] ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς καὶ
[[τὰ] ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, or τὰ πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ
... ἔκτισται, or τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν,
refer to the work of the Incarnation,
is to strain language in a way
which would reduce all theological
exegesis to chaos; and yet this, as
Marcellus truly saw, is a strictly logical
consequence of the interpretation
which refers πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως
to Christ’s humanity. (3) It takes no
account of the cosmogony and angelology
of the false teachers against
which the Apostle’s exposition here
is directed (see above, pp. 101 sq.,
110 sq., 181 sq.). This interpretation
is given by St Athanasius <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Arian.</cite></span>
ii. 62 sq. (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 419 sq.) and appears
again in Greg. Nyss. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Eunom.</cite></span> ii
(<span class='fss'>II.</span> pp. 451–453, 492), <em>ib.</em> iii (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p.
540–545), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Perf.</cite></span> (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 290 sq.),
Cyril Alex. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Thes.</cite></span> 25, p. 236 sq., <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de

(quoted as Chrysostom by Photius
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Bibl.</cite></span> 277). So too Cyril expresses
himself at the Council of Ephesus,
Labb. <cite>Conc.</cite>  <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 652 (ed. Colet.).
St Athanasius indeed does not confine
the expression to the condescension
(συγκατάβασις) of the Word in the Incarnation,
but includes also a prior
condescension in the Creation of the
world (see Bull <cite>Def. Fid. Nic.</cite> iii. 9. §
1, with the remarks of Newman <cite>Select
Treatises of S. Athanasius</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> pp. 278,
368 sq.). This double reference however
only confuses the exegesis of
the passage still further, while theologically
it might lead to very serious
difficulties. In another work, <cite>Expos.
Fid.</cite> 3 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 80), he seems to take a
truer view of its meaning. St Basil,
who to an equally clear appreciation
of doctrine generally unites a sounder
exegesis than St Athanasius, while mentioning
the interpretation which refers
the expression to Christ’s human nature,
himself prefers explaining it
of the Eternal Word; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Eunom.</cite></span> iv (I.
p. 292). Of the Greek commentators
on this passage, Chrysostom’s view is
not clear; Severianus (Cram. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Cat.</cite></span> p.
303) and Theodoret understand it
rightly of the Eternal Word; while
Theodore of Mopsuestia (Cram. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Cat.</cite></span>
pp. 306, 308, 309, Rab. Maur. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VI.</span>
p. 511 sq. ed. Migne) expresses himself
very strongly on the opposite
side. Like Marcellus, he carries the
interpretation consistently into the
whole context, explaining ἐν αὐτῷ to
refer not to the original creation (κτίσις)
but to the moral re-creation
(ἀνάκτισις), and referring εἰκών to the
Incarnation in the same way. At a
later date, when the pressure of an
immediate controversy has passed
away, the Greek writers generally
concur in the earlier and truer interpretation
of the expression. Thus
John Damascene (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Orthod. Fid.</cite></span> iv.
8, I. p. 258 sq.), Theophylact (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad loc.</cite></span>),
and &OElig;cumenius (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad loc.</cite></span>), all explain
it of Christ’s Divine Nature. Among
Latin writers, there is more diversity
of interpretation. While Marius
Victorinus (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Arium</cite></span> i. 24, p.
1058, ed. Migne), Hilary of Poictiers
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Tract. in ii Ps.</cite></span> § 28 sq. I. p. 47 sq. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Trin.</cite></span> viii. 50, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 248 sq.), and Hilary
the commentator (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad loc.</cite></span>), take it of
the Divine Nature, Augustine (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Expos.
ad Rom.</cite></span> 56, <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 914) and Pelagius
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad loc.</cite></span>) understand it of the Incarnate
Christ. This sketch of the history of
the interpretation of the expression
would not be complete without a reference
to another very different explanation.
Isidore of Pelusium, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist.</cite></span>
iii. 31 (p. 268), would strike out a new
path of interpretation altogether (εἰ
καὶ δόξαιμί τισι καινοτέραν ἑρμηνίας
ἀνατέμνειν ὁδόν), and for the passive
πρωτότοκος suggests reading the active
πρωτοτόκος, alluding to the use of this
latter word in Homer (<cite>Il.</cite> xvii. 5 μήτηρ
πρωτοτόκος ... οὐ πρὶν εἰδυῖα τόκοιο:
comp. Plat. <cite>Theæt.</cite> 151 <span class='fss'>C</span> ὥσπερ αἱ
πρωτοτόκοι). Thus St Paul is made
to say that Christ πρῶτον τετοκέναι,
τουτέστι, πεποιηκέναι τὴν κτίσιν.</p>

the justification of the title

the sense in which this title is used.
Thus connected, it shows that the
πρωτότοκος Himself is not included
in πᾶσα κτίσις; for the expression
used is not τὰ ἄλλα or τὰ λοιπά, but
τὰ πάντα ἐκτίσθη–words which are
absolute and comprehensive, and will
admit no exception.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν αὐτῷ] ‘<em>in Him</em>,’ as below ver.
17 ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν. For the preposition
comp. Acts xvii, 28 ἐν αὐτῷ
γὰρ ζῶμεν καὶ κινούμεθα καί ἐσμεν.
All the laws and purposes which
guide the creation and government
of the Universe reside in Him, the
Eternal Word, as their meeting-point.
The Apostolic doctrine of the Logos
teaches us to regard the Eternal
Word as holding the same relation to
the Universe which the Incarnate
Christ holds to the Church. He is
the source of its life, the centre of all
its developments, the mainspring of
all its motions. The use of ἐν to
describe His relations to the Church
abounds in St Paul (e.g. Rom. viii. 1,
2, xii. 5, xvi. 3, 7, 9, etc., 1 Cor. i. 30,
iv. 15, 17, vii. 39, xv. 18, 22, etc.), and
more especially in the Epistles to the
Colossians and Ephesians (e.g. below
ii. 7, 10). In the present passage, as
in ver. 17, the same preposition is
applied also to His relations to the
Universe; comp. Joh. i. 4 ἐν αὐτῷ
ζωὴ ἦν (more especially if we connect
the preceding ὃ γέγονεν with it).</p>

<p class='c034'>Thus it is part of the parallelism
which runs through the whole passage,
and to which the occurrence of
πρωτότοκος in both relations gives the
key. The Judæo-Alexandrian teachers
represented the Logos, which in their
view was nothing more than the
Divine mind energizing, as the τόπος
where the eternal ideas, the νοητὸς
κόσμος, had their abode; Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Mund. Op.</cite></span> 4 (I. p. 4) ὅσαπερ ἐν ἐκείνῳ

The Apostolic teaching is an
enlargement of this conception, inasmuch
as the Logos is no longer a
philosophical abstraction but a Divine
Person: see Hippol. <cite>Hær.</cite> x.

<p class='c034'>τὰ πάντα] ‘<em>the universe of things</em>,’
not πάντα ‘all things severally,’ but
τὰ πάντα ‘all things collectively.’ With
very few exceptions, wherever this
phrase occurs elsewhere, it stands in a
similar connexion; see below, vv. 17,
20, iii. 11, Rom. xi. 36, 1 Cor. viii. 6,
xi. 12, xii. 6, xv. 27, 28, 2 Cor. v. 18,
Eph. i. 10, 11, 23, iv. 10, Heb. i. 3,

22 ἔιτε κόσμος ... ὑμῶν; and Phil. iii. 8
τὰ πάντα εζημιώθην with Matt. xvi.
26 ἐὰ τὸν κόσμον ὅλον κερδήσῃ. Thus
it will appear that τὰ πάντα is nearly
equivalent to ‘the universe.’ It
stands midway between πάντα and τὸ
πᾶν. The last however is not a scriptural
phrase; for, while with τὰ πάντα
it involves the idea of connexion, it
suggests also the unscriptural idea of
<em>self-contained</em> unity, the great world-soul
of the Stoic pantheist.</p>

It is a classification by <em>locality</em>, as the
other is a classification by <em>essences</em>.
Heaven and earth together comprehend
all space; and all things
whether material or immaterial are
conceived for the purposes of the
classification as having their abode in
space. Thus the sun and the moon
would belong to ὁρατά, but they would
be ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς; while the human

<p class='c034'>It is difficult to say whether τὰ ... τα
should be expunged or retained. The
elements in the decision are; (1) The
facility either of omission or of addition
in the first clause, owing to the
termination of πάντα: (2) The much
greater authority for the omission in
the first clause than in the second.
These two combined suggest that τὰ
was omitted accidentally in the first
clause, and then expunged purposely
in the second for the sake of uniformity.
On the other hand there is
(3) The possibility of insertion in both
cases either for the sake of grammatical
completeness or owing to the
parallel passages, ver. 20, Ephes. i.

<p class='c033'>εἴτε κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>whether they be thrones
or lordships, etc.</em>’ The subdivision is
no longer exhaustive. The Apostle
singles out those created beings that
from their superior rank had been or
might be set in rivalry with the Son.</p>

<p class='c034'>A comparison with the parallel
passage Ephes. i. 21, ὑπεράνω πάσης
ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας καὶ δυνάμεως καὶ
κυριότητος καὶ παντὸς κ.τ.λ., brings out
the following points:</p>

<p class='c034'>(1) No stress can be laid on the
sequence of the names, as though St
Paul were enunciating with authority
some precise doctrine respecting the
grades of the celestial hierarchy. The
names themselves are not the same
in the two passages. While ἀρχή, ἐξουσία,
κυριότης, are common to both,
θρόνος is peculiar to the one and
δύναμις to the other. Nor again is
there any correspondence in the sequence.
Neither does δύναμις take
the place of θρόνος, nor do the three
words common to both appear in the
same order, the sequence being ἀρχ.
ἐξ. [δύν.] κυρ. in Eph. i. 21, and [θρόν.]
κυρ. ἀρχ. ἐξ. here.</p>

<p class='c034'>(2)   An expression in Eph. i. 21
shows the Apostle’s <em>motive</em> in introducing
these lists of names: for he
there adds καὶ παντὸς ὀνόματος ὀνομαζομένον
οὐ μόνον ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ
ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι, i.e. ‘of every
dignity or title (whether real or imaginary)
which is reverenced,’ etc.; for
this is the force of παντὸς ὀνόματος
ὀνομαζομένον (see the notes on Phil.
ii. 9, and Eph. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>l.c.</cite></span>). Hence it appears
that in this catalogue St Paul does
not profess to describe objective
realities, but contents himself with
repeating subjective opinions. He
brushes away all these speculations
without enquiring how much
or how little truth there may be in
them, because they are altogether
beside the question. His language
here shows the same spirit of impatience
with this elaborate angelology,
as in <a href='#II_18'>ii. 18</a>.</p>

<p class='c034'>(3)  Some commentators have referred
the terms used here solely to
earthly potentates and dignities.
There can be little doubt however
that their chief and primary reference
is to the orders of the celestial hierarchy,
as conceived by these Gnostic
Judaizers. This appears from the context;
for the words τὰ ἀόρατα immediately
precede this list of terms, while
in the mention of πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα
and in other expressions the Apostle
clearly contemplates the rivalry of
<em>spiritual</em> powers with Christ. It is
also demanded by the whole design
and purport of the letter, which is
written to combat the worship paid to
angels. The names too, more especially
θρόνοι, are especially connected with
the speculations of Jewish angelology.
But when this is granted, two questions
still remain. First; are evil as well as
good spirits included, demons as well
as angels? And next; though the
primary reference is to spiritual
powers, is it not possible that the
expression was intended to be comprehensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and to include earthly dignities
as well? The clause added in the
parallel passage, οὐ μόνον ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι
τούτῳ κ.τ.λ., encourages us thus to
extend the Apostle’s meaning; and we
are led in the same direction by the
comprehensive words which have preceded
here, [τὰ] ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς
κ.τ.λ. Nor is there anything in the
terms themselves which bars such an
extension; for, as will be seen, the
combination ἀπχαὶ καὶ ἐξουσίαι is
applied not only to good angels but
to bad, not only to spiritual powers
but to earthly. Compare Ignat.
<cite>Smyrn.</cite> 6 τὰ ἐπουράνια καὶ ἡ δόξα τῶν
ἀγγέλων καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ὀρατοί τε καὶ
ἀόρατοι.</p>

<p class='c034'>Thus guided, we may paraphrase
the Apostle’s meaning as follows:
‘You dispute much about the successive
grades of angels; you distinguish
each grade by its special title; you
can tell how each order was generated
from the preceding; you assign to
each its proper degree of worship.
Meanwhile you have ignored or you
have degraded Christ. I tell you, it
is not so. He is first and foremost,
Lord of heaven and earth, far above
all thrones or dominations, all princedoms
or powers, far above every
dignity and every potentate—whether
earthly or heavenly—whether angel
or demon or man—that evokes your
reverence or excites your fear.’ See
above, pp. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a> sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>Jewish and Judæo-Christian speculations
respecting the grades of the
celestial hierarchy took various forms.
In the <cite>Testaments of the Twelve
Patriarchs</cite> (Levi 3), which as coming
near to the Apostolic age supplies a
valuable illustration (see <cite>Galatians</cite>
p. 307 sq.), these orders are arranged
as follows: (1) θρόνοι, ἐξουσίαι, these
two in the highest or seventh heaven;
(2) οἱ ἄγγελοι οἱ φέροντες τὰς ἀποκρίσεις
τοῖς ἀγγέλοις τοῦ προσώπου in
the sixth heaven; (3) οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ
προσώπου in the fifth heaven; (4) οἱ
ἄγιοι in the fourth heaven; (5) αἱ δυνάμεις
 τῶν παρεμβολῶν in the third
heaven; (6) τὰ πνεύματα τῶν ἐπαγωγῶν
(i.e. of visitations, retributions) in the second
heaven: or perhaps the denizens
of the sixth and fifth heavens, (2) and
(3), should be transposed. The lowest
heaven is not peopled by any spirits.
In Origen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Princ.</cite></span> i. 5. 3, <em>ib.</em> i. 6.
2, <span class='fss'>I.</span> pp. 66, 70 (comp. i. 8. 1, <em>ib.</em> p. 74),
we have five classes, which are given
in an ascending scale in this order;
(1) angels (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sancti angeli</em></span>, τάξις ἀγγελική);
(2) princedoms (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>principatus</em></span>,
δύναμις ἀρχική, ἀρχαί); (3) powers (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>potestates</em></span>,
ἐξουσίαι); (4) thrones (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>throni
vel sedes</em></span>, θρόνοι); (5) dominations
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>dominationes</em></span>, κυρίοτητες); though
elsewhere, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Ioann.</cite></span> i. § 34, IV. p. 34,
he seems to have a somewhat different
classification in view. In Ephrem
Syrus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op. Syr.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 270 (where the
translation of Benedetti is altogether
faulty and misleading) the ranks are
these: (1) θεοί, θρόνοι, κυριότητες; (2)
ἀρχάγγελοι, ἀρχαί, ἐξουσίαι; (3) ἄγγελοι,
δυνάμεις, χερουβίμ, σεραφίμ; these three
great divisions being represented by
the χιλίαρχοι, the ἐκατόνταρχοι, and the
πεντηκόνταρχοι respectively in Deut.
i. 15, on which passage he is commenting.
The general agreement between
these will be seen at once. This
grouping also seems to underlie the
conception of Basil of Seleucia <cite>Orat.</cite>
39 (p. 207), who mentions them in this
order; θρόνοι, κυριότητες, ἀρχαί, ἐξουσίαι,
δυνάμεις, χερουβίμ, σεραφίμ.
On the other hand the arrangement of
the pseudo-Dionysius, who so largely
influenced subsequent speculations,
is quite different and probably later
(Dion. Areop. <cite>Op.</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 75, ed. Cord.);
(1) θρόνοι, χερουβίμ, σεραφίμ; (2) ἐξουσίαι,
κυριότητες, δυνάμεις; (3) ἄγγελοι,
ἀρχάγγελοι, ἀρχαι. But the earlier
lists for the most part seem to
suggest as their common foundation a
classification in which θρόνοι, κυριότητες,
belonged to the highest order, and
ἀρχαί, ἐξουσίαι to the next below.
Thus it would appear that the Apostle
takes as an illustration the titles
assigned to the two highest grades in
a system of the celestial hierarchy
which he found current, and which
probably was adopted by these Gnostic
Judaizers. See also the note on
ii. 18.</p>

<p class='c034'>θρόνοι] In all systems alike these
‘thrones’ belong to the highest grade
of angelic beings, whose place is in
the immediate presence of God. The
meaning of the name however is
doubtful: (1) It may signify the <em>occupants
of thrones</em> which surround the
throne of God; as in the imagery of
Rev. iv. 4 κύκλοθεν τοῦ θρόνου θρόνοι
εἴκοσι τέσσαρες (comp. xi. 16, xx. 4).
The imagery is there taken from the
court of an earthly king: see Jer. lii.
32. This is the interpretation given
by Origen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Princ.</cite></span> i. 5. 3 (p. 66), i.
6. 2 (p. 70) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘judicandi vel regendi ...
habentes officium.’</span> Or (2) They were
so called, as <em>supporting or forming
the throne of God</em>; just as the chariot-seat
of the Almighty is represented
as resting on the cherubim in Ezek.
i. 26, ix. 3, x. 1 sq., xi. 22, Ps. xviii. 10,
1 Chron. xxviii. 18. So apparently
Clem. Alex. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Proph. Ecl.</cite></span> 57 (p. 1003)
θρόνοι ἂν εἶεν ... διὰ τὸ ἀναπαύσθαι ἐν
αὐτοῖς τὸν Θεόν. From this same
imagery of the prophet the later mysticism
of the Kabbala derived its
name ‘wheels,’ which it gave to one
of its ten orders of Sephiroth. Adopting
this interpretation, several fathers
identify the ‘thrones’ with the cherubim:
e.g. Greg. Nyss. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad Eunom.</cite></span>
i (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 349 sq.), Chrysost. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Incompr.
Nat.</cite></span> iii. 5 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 467), Theodoret (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad
loc.</cite></span>), August. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Psalm.</cite></span> xcviii. § 3
(iv. p. 1061). This explanation was
adopted also by the pseudo-Dionysius
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de C&oelig;l. Hier.</cite></span> 7 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 80), without however
identifying them with the cherubim;
and through his writings it came
to be generally adopted. The former
interpretation however is more probable;
for (1) This highly symbolical
nomenclature accords better with a
later stage of mystic speculation, like
the Kabbala; and (2) It seems natural
to treat θρόνοι as belonging to the
same category with κυριότητες, ἀρχαί,
ἐξουσίαι, which are concrete words
borrowed from different grades of
human rank and power. As implying
<em>regal</em> dignity, θρόνοι naturally stands
at the head of the list.</p>

<p class='c034'>κυριότητες] ‘<em>dominations</em>,’ as Ephes.
i. 21. These appear to have been regarded
as belonging to the first grade,
and standing next in dignity to the
θρόνοι. This indeed would be suggested
by their name.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀρχαί, ἐξουσίαι as Ephes. i. 21.
These two words occur very frequently
together. In some places they refer
to human dignities, as Luke xii. 11,
Tit. iii. 1 (comp. Luke xx. 20); in
others to a spiritual hierarchy. And
here again there are two different
uses: sometimes they designate good
angels, e.g. below ii. 10, Ephes. iii. 10;
sometimes evil spirits, e.g. ii. 15,
Ephes. vi. 12: while in one passage at
least (1 Cor. xv. 24) both may be included.
In Rom. viii. 38 we have ἀρχαὶ
without ἐξουσίαι (except as a v. l.),
and in 1 Pet. iii. 22 ἐξουσίαι without
ἀρχαί, in connexion with the angelic
orders.</p>

passed out from Him, so does it all converge

combination of prepositions see Rom.
xi. 36 ἐξ αὐτοῦ καὶ δι’ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν
τὰ πάντα. He is not only the <span class="uncial">α</span> but
also the <span class="uncial">ω</span>, not only the ἀρχή but also
the τέλος of creation, not only the first
but also the last in the history of
the Universe: Rev. xxii. 13. For
this double relation of Christ to the
Universe, as both the initial and the
final cause, see Heb. ii. 10 δι’ ὃν τὰ
πάντα καὶ δι’ οὗ τὰ πάντα, where δι’ ὃν
is nearly equivalent to εἰς αὐτὸν of the
text.</p>

<p class='c034'>In the Judaic philosophy of Alexandria
the preposition διὰ with the
genitive was commonly used to describe
the function of the Logos in
the creation and government of the
world; e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Cherub.</cite></span> 35 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 162)
where Philo, enumerating the causes
which combine in the work of Creation,
describes God as ὑφ’ οὗ, matter
as ἐξ οὗ, and the Word as δι’ οὗ;
comp. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mon.</cite></span> ii. 5 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 225) λόγος ... δι’
οὗ σύμπας ὁ κόσμος ἐδημιουργεῖτο.
The Christian Apostles accepted this
use of διὰ to describe the mediatorial
function of the Word in creation; e.g.
John i. 3 πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο κ.τ.λ.,
<em>ib.</em> ver. 10 ὁ κόσμος δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο,
Heb. i. 2 δι’ οὗ καὶ ἐποίησεν τοὺς
αἰῶνας. This mediatorial function
however has entirely changed its
character. To the Alexandrian Jew it
was the work of a passive tool or instrument
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Cherub.</cite></span> l.c. δι’ οὗ, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τὸ ἐργαλεῖον</em>&nbsp;,
ὄργανον ... δι’ οὗ); but to the
Christian Apostle it represented a
cooperating agent. Hence the Alexandrian
Jew frequently and consistently
used the simple instrumental
dative ᾧ to describe the relation of
the Word to the Creator, e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quod
Deus immut.</cite></span> 12 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 281) ᾧ καὶ τὸν
κόσμον εἰργάζετο, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. All.</cite></span> i. 9 (<span class='fss'>I.</span>
p. 47) τῷ περιφανεστάτῳ καὶ τηλαυγεστάτῳ
ἑαυτοῦ λόγῳ ῥήματι ὁ Θεὸς ἀμφότερα
ποιεῖ, comp. <em>ib.</em> iii. 31 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 106)
ὁ λόγος ... ᾧ καθάπερ ὀργάνῳ προσχρησάμενος.
This mode of speaking is not
found in the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c034'>εἰς αὐτόν] ‘<em>unto Him</em>.’ As of the
Father it is said elsewhere, 1 Cor. viii.
6 ἐξ ὁῦ τὰ πάντα καὶ ἡμεῖς εἰς αὐτόν,
so here of the Son we read τὰ πάντα
δι’ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτόν. All things
must find their meeting-point, their reconciliation,
at length in Him from
whom they took their rise—in the
Word as the mediatorial agent, and
through the Word in the Father as
the primary source. The Word is
the final cause as well as the creative
agent of the Universe. This ultimate
goal of the present dispensation in
time is similarly stated in several passages.
Sometimes it is represented
as the birth-throe and deliverance of
all creation through Christ; as Rom.
viii. 19 sq. αὐτὴ ἡ κτίσις ἐλευθερωθήσεται,
πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις ... συνωδίνει. Sometimes
it is the absolute and final subjection
of universal nature to Him;
as 1 Cor. xv. 28 ὅταν ὑποταγῇ αὐτῷ
τὰ πάντα. Sometimes it is the reconciliation
of all things through Him; as
below, ver. 20 δι’ αὐτοῦ ἀποκαταλλάξαι
τὰ πάντα. Sometimes it is the recapitulation,
the gathering up in one
head, of the Universe in Him; as
Ephes. i. 10 ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι τὰ
πάντα ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ. The image involved
in this last passage best illustrates
the particular expression in the
text εἰς αὐτόν ... ἔκτισται; but all alike
enunciate the same truth in different
terms. The Eternal Word is the goal
of the Universe, as He was the starting-point.
It must end in unity, as it
proceeded from unity: and the centre
of this unity is Christ. This expression
has no parallel, and could have
none, in the Alexandrian phraseology
and doctrine.</p>

Rev. xix. 15 καὶ αὐτὸς ποιμανεῖ ... καὶ

which explains πρὸ πάντων of superiority
in rank, and not of priority in
time, is untenable for several reasons.
(1) This would most naturally be expressed
otherwise in Biblical language,
as ἐπὶ πάντων (e.g. Rom. ix. 5, Eph. iv.
6), or ὑπὲρ πάντα (Eph. i. 22), or ὑπεράνω
πάντων (Eph. i. 21, iv. 10). (2)
The key to the interpretation is given
by the analogous words in the context,
esp. πρωτότοκος, vv. 15, 18. (3)
Nothing short of this declaration of
absolute pre-existence would be adequate
to introduce the statement
which follows, καὶ τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ
συνέστηκεν.</p>

<p class='c034'>πρὸ πάντων] ‘<em>before all things</em>.’ In

He is the principle of cohesion in the

that unity and solidarity which makes
it a cosmos instead of a chaos. Thus
(to take one instance) the action of
gravitation, which keeps in their places
things fixed and regulates the motions
of things moving, is an expression
of His mind. Similarly in Heb.

natural creation. He stands also in
the same relation to the Church—the
new spiritual creation. He is its
head, and it is His body. This is His
prerogative, because He is the source
and the beginning of its life, being
the First-born from the dead. Thus
in all things—in the spiritual order as
in the natural—in the Church as in
the World—He is found to have the
pre-eminence.’</p>

<p class='c034'>The elevating influence of this
teaching on the choicest spirits of the
subapostolic age will be seen from
a noble passage in the noblest of
early Christian writings, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist. ad

<p class='c034'>καὶ αὐτὸς] ‘<em>and He</em>,’ repeated from
the preceding verse, to emphasize the
identity of the Person who unites in
Himself these prerogatives: see on
ver. 17, and comp. ver. 18 αὐτός, ver.
19 δι’ αὐτοῦ. The Creator of the
World is also the Head of the Church.
There is no blind ignorance, no imperfect
sympathy, no latent conflict, in
the relation of the demiurgic power
to the Gospel dispensation, as the
heretical teachers were disposed consciously
or unconsciously to assume
(see above, p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a> sq., p. <a href='#Page_110'>110</a> sq.), but

<p class='c034'>ἡ κεφαλή] ‘<em>the head</em>,’ the inspiring,
ruling, guiding, combining, sustaining
power, the mainspring of its activity,
the centre of its unity, and the seat
of its life. In his earlier epistles the
relations of the Church to Christ are
described under the same image (1
Cor. xii. 12–27; comp. vi. 15, x. 17,
Rom. xii. 4 sq.); but the Apostle
there takes as his starting-point the
various functions of the members, and
not, as in these later epistles, the
originating and controlling power of
the Head. Comp. i. 24, ii. 19, Eph.

<p class='c034'>ἀρχή] ‘<em>the origin</em>, <em>the beginning</em>.’
The term is here applied to the Incarnate
Christ in relation to the
Church, because it is applicable to
the Eternal Word in relation to the
Universe, Rev. iii. 14 ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς κτίσεως
τοῦ Θεοῦ. The parallelism of the
two relations is kept in view throughout.
The word ἀρχή here involves
two ideas: (1) Priority in time; Christ
was the first-fruits of the dead, ἀπαρχή
(1 Cor. xv. 20, 23): (2) Originating
power; Christ was also the source of
life, Acts  iii. 14 ὁ ἀρχηγὸς τῆς ζωῆς;
comp. Acts v. 31, Heb. ii. 10. He is
not merely the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>principium principiatum</em></span>
but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>principium principians</em></span>
(see Trench <cite>Epistles to the
Seven Churches</cite> p. 183 sq.). He rose
first from the dead, that others might
rise through Him.</p>

<p class='c034'>The word ἀρχή, like πρῶτος (see
the note on Phil. i. 5), being absolute
in itself, does not require the definite
article. Indeed the article is most
commonly omitted where ἀρχή occurs
as a predicate, as will appear from

<p class='c034'>The text is read with the definite
article, ἡ ἀρχή, in one or two excellent
authorities at least; but the obvious
motive which would lead a
scribe to aim at greater distinctness
renders the reading suspicious.</p>

<p class='c034'>πρωτότοκος] Comp. Rev. i. 5 ὁ πρωτότοκος
τῶν νεκρῶν καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν
βασιλέων τῆς γῆς. His resurrection
from the dead is His title to the
headship of the Church; for ‘the
power of His resurrection’ (Phil. iii.
10) is the life of the Church. Such
passages as Gen. xlix. 3, Deut. xxi. 17,
where the πρωτότοκος is called ἀρχὴ
τέκνων and superior privileges are
claimed for him as such, must necessarily
be only very faint and partial
illustrations of the connexion between
ἀρχὴ and πρωτότοκος here, where the
subject-matter and the whole context
point to a fuller meaning of the words.
The words πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν
here correspond to πρωτότοκος πάσης
κτίσεως ver. 15, so that the parallelism
between Christ’s relations to the Universe
and to the Church is thus emphasized.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἵνα γένηται κ.τ.λ.] As He <em>is</em> first
with respect to the Universe, so it
was ordained that He should <em>become</em>
first with respect to the Church as
well. The &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>γένηται</em>&nbsp; here answers in a
manner to the &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἔστιν</em>&nbsp; of ver. 17. Thus
ἔστιν and γένηται are contrasted as
the absolute being and the historical
manifestation. The relation between
Christ’s headship of the Universe
by virtue of His Eternal Godhead
and His headship of the Church
by virtue of His Incarnation and
Passion and Resurrection is somewhat
similarly represented in Phil. ii.
6 sq. ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὕαρχων ... μορφὴν

θανάτου ... &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>διὸ</em>&nbsp; καὶ ὁ Θεὸς αὐτὸν ὑπερύψωσεν
κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν πᾶσιν] ‘<em>in all things</em>’ not in the
Universe only but in the Church
also. Καὶ γάρ, writes Theodoret, ὡς
Θεὸς, πρὸ πάντων ἐστὶ καὶ σὺν τῷ πατρί
ἐστι, καὶ ὡς ἄνθρωπος, πρωτότοκος ἐκ
τῶν νεκρῶν καὶ τοῦ σώματος κεφαλή.
Thus ἐν πᾶσιν is neuter and not masculine,
as it is sometimes taken. Either
construction is grammatically
correct, but the context points to the
former interpretation here; and this
is the common use of ἐν πᾶσιν, e.g.
iii. 11, Eph. i. 23, Phil. iv. 12. For
the neuter compare Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 9

[Demosth.] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Amat.</cite></span> p. 1416 κράτιστον
εἶναι τὸ πρωτεύειν ἐν ἅπασι the context
shows that ἅπασι is masculine.</p>

<p class='c034'>αὐτὸς] ‘<em>He Himself</em>’; see the note
on καὶ αὐτὸς above.</p>

<p class='c034'><a href='#I_19'>19, 20.</a> ‘And this absolute supremacy
is His, because it was the
Father’s good pleasure that in Him
all the plenitude of Deity should have
its home; because He willed through
Him to reconcile the Universe once
more to Himself. It was God’s purpose
to effect peace and harmony
through the blood of Christ’s cross,
and so to restore all things, whatsoever
and wheresoever they be, whether
on the earth or in the heavens.’</p>

<p class='c034'>19. ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ κ.τ.λ.] The eternal
indwelling of the Godhead explains
the headship of the Church, not less
than the headship of the Universe.
The resurrection of Christ, whereby
He became the ἀρχὴ of the Church,
was the result of and the testimony to
His deity; Rom. i. 4 τοῦ ὁρισθέντος
υἱοῦ Θεοῦ ... ἐξ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν.</p>

<p class='c034'>εὐδόκησεν] sc. ὁ Θεός, the nominative
being understood; see Winer
§ lviii. p. 655 sq., § lxiv. p. 735 sq.;
comp. James i. 12 (the right reading),
iv. 6. Here the omission is the more
easy, because εὐδοκία, εὐδοκεῖν etc. (like
θέλημα) are used absolutely of God’s
good purpose, e.g. Luke ii. 14 ἐν ἀνθρῶποις
εὐδοκίας (or εὐδοκία), Phil. ii.
13 ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐδοκίας, Clem. Rom. § 40
πάντα τὰ γινόμενα ἐν εὐδοκήσει; see the
note in Clem. Rom. § 2. For the expression
generally comp. 2 Macc. xiv.
35 σύ, Κύριε, εὐδόκησας ναὸν τῆς σῆς
κατασκηνώσεως ἐν ἡμῖν γενέσθαι. The
alternative is to consider πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα
personified as the nominative;
but it is difficult to conceive St Paul
so speaking, more especially as with
εὐδόκησεν personification would suggest
personality. The πλήρωμα indeed
is personified in Clem. Alex.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Exc. Theod.</cite></span> 43 (p. 979) συναινέσαντος
καὶ τοῦ πληρώματος, and in Iren. i. 2.
6 βουλῇ μιᾷ καὶ γνώμῃ τὸ πᾶν πλήρωμα
τῶν αἰώνων κ.τ.λ., i. 12. 4 πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα
ηὐδόκησεν [δι’ αὐτοῦ δοξάσαι τὸν
πάτερα]; but the phraseology of the
Valentinians, to which these passages
refer, cannot be taken as an indication
of St Paul’s usage, since their view
of the πλήρωμα was wholly different.
A third interpretation is found in
Tertullian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Marc.</cite></span> v. 19, who translates
ἐν αὐτῷ <em>in semetipso</em>, taking ὁ
Χριστὸς as the nominative to εὐδόκησεν:
and this construction is followed
by some modern critics. But, though
grammatically possible, it confuses
the theology of the passage hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸ πλήρωμα] ‘<em>the plenitude</em>,’ a recognised
technical term in theology,
denoting the totality of the Divine
powers and attributes; comp. ii. 9.
See the detached note on πλήρωμα.
On the relation of this statement to
the speculations of the false teachers
at Colossæ see the introduction,
pp. 102, 112. Another interpretation,
which explains τὸ πλήρωμα as referring
to the Church (comp. Ephes. i.
22), though adopted by several fathers,
is unsuited to the context and has
nothing to recommend it.</p>

<p class='c034'>κατοικῆσαι] ‘<em>should have its permanent
abode</em>.’ The word occurs again
in the same connexion, ii. 9. The
false teachers probably, like their
later counterparts, maintained only a
partial and transient connexion of the
πλήρωμα with the Lord. Hence St
Paul declares in these two passages
that it is not a παροικία but a κατοικία.
The two words κατοικεῖν, παροικεῖν,
occur in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> as the common
renderings of <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">ישב</span> and <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">נור</span> respectively,
and are distinguished as the
<em>permanent</em> and the <em>transitory</em>; e.g.

<p class='c033'>20. The false teachers aimed at
effecting a partial reconciliation between
God and man through the interposition
of angelic mediators. The
Apostle speaks of an absolute and
complete reconciliation of universal
nature to God, effected through the
mediation of the Incarnate Word.
Their mediators were ineffective, because
they were neither human nor
divine. The true mediator must be
both human and divine. It was
necessary that in Him all the plenitude
of the Godhead should dwell.
It was necessary also that He should
be born into the world and should
suffer as a man.</p>

<p class='c034'>δι’ αὐτοῦ] i.e. τοῦ Χριστοῦ, as appears
from the preceding ἐν αὐτῷ,
and the following διὰ τοῦ αἵματος
τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ, [δι’ αὐτοῦ]. This
expression δι’ αὐτοῦ has been already
applied to the Preincarnate Word in
relation to the Universe (ver. 16); it
is now used of the Incarnate Word in
relation to the Church.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀποκαταλλάξαι] sc. εὐδόκησεν ὁ Θεός.
The personal pronoun αὐτόν, instead
of the reflexive ἑαυτόν, is no real obstacle
to this way of connecting the
words (see the next note). The alternative
would be to take τὸ πλήρωμα
as governing ἀποκαταλλάξαι, but
this mode of expression is harsh and
improbable.</p>

<p class='c034'>The same double compound ἀποκαταλλάσσειν
is used below, ver. 21 and
Ephes. ii. 16, in place of the usual καταλλάσσειν.
It may be compared
with ἀποκατάστασις, Acts iii. 21. Tertullian,
arguing against the dualism
of Marcion who maintained an antagonism
between the demiurge and the
Christ, lays stress on the compound,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Marc.</cite></span> v. 19 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>conciliari</em> extraneo
possent, <em>reconciliari</em> vero non alii
quam suo.’</span> The word ἀποκαταλλάσσειν
corresponds to ἀπηλλοτριωμένους
here and in Ephes. ii. 16, implying a
<em>restitution</em> to a state from which they
had fallen, or which was potentially
theirs, or for which they were destined.
Similarly St Augustine on Gal. iv. 5
remarks that the word used of the
υἱοθεσία is not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>accipere</em></span> (λαμβάνειν)
but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>recipere</em></span> (ἀπολαμβάνειν). See the
note there.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὰ πάντα] The whole universe of
things, material as well as spiritual,
shall be restored to harmony with
God. How far this restoration of
universal nature maybe subjective, as
involved in the changed perceptions
of man thus brought into harmony
with God, and how far it may have an
objective and independent existence,
it were vain to speculate.</p>

The reconciliation is always
represented as made to the Father.
The reconciler is sometimes the Father
Himself (2 Cor. v. 18, 19 ἐκ τοῦ
Θεοῦ τοῦ καταλλάξαντος ἡμᾶς ἑαυτῷ
διὰ Χριστοῦ ... Θεὸς ἐν Χριστῷ κόσμον
καταλλάσσων ἑαυτῷ), sometimes the
Son (Ephes. ii. 16: comp. Rom. v.
10, 11). Excellent reasons are given
(Bleek <cite>Hebr.</cite> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 69, A. Buttmann
<cite>Gramm.</cite> p. 97) for supposing that the
reflexive pronoun ἑαυτοῦ etc. is never
contracted into αὐτοῦ etc. in the
Greek Testament. But at the same
time it is quite clear that the oblique
cases of the personal pronoun αὐτός are
there used very widely, and in cases
where we should commonly find the
reflexive pronoun in classical authors:
e.g. Ephes. i. 4, 5 ἐξελέξατο ἡμᾶς ...
εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους κατενώπιον
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>αὐτοῦ</em>&nbsp; ... προορίσας ἡμᾶς εἰς ὑιοθεσίαν
διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ εἰς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>αὐτόν</em>&nbsp;. See
also the instances given in A. Buttmann
p. 98. It would seem indeed
that αὐτοῦ etc. may be used for ἑαυτοῦ
etc. in almost every connexion,
except where it is the direct object
of the verb.</p>

<p class='c034'>εἰρηνοποιήσας] The word occurs in
the <span class='fss'>LXX</span>, Prov. x. 10, and in Hermes
in Stob. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ecl. Phys.</cite></span> xli. 45. The substantive
εἰρηνοποιός (see Matt. v. 9)
is found several times in classical
writers.</p>

<p class='c034'>δι’ αὐτοῦ] The external authority
for and against these words is nearly
evenly balanced: but there would
obviously be a tendency to reject
them as superfluous. They are a resumption
of the previous δι’ αὐτοῦ.
For other examples see ii. 13 ὑμᾶς,
Rom. viii. 23 καὶ αὐτοὶ, Gal. ii. 15, 16
ἡμεῖς, Ephes. i. 13 ἐν ᾧ καί, iii. 1, 14
τούτου χάριν, where words are similarly
repeated for the sake of emphasis
or distinctness. In 2 Cor. xii. 7 there
is a repetition of ἵνα μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι,
where again it is omitted in several
excellent authorities.</p>

<p class='c034'><a href='#I_21'>21–23.</a> ‘And ye too—ye Gentiles—are

Christ’s body, in Christ’s flesh which
died on the Cross for your atonement,
ye are reconciled to Him again. He
will present you a living sacrifice, an
acceptable offering unto Himself, free
from blemish and free even from
censure, that ye may stand the piercing
glance of Him whose scrutiny
no defect can escape. But this
can only be, if ye remain true to

καρδίας αὐτῶν. So καρδίᾳ, καρδίαις,
Matt. v. 8, xi. 29, Acts vii. 51, 2 Cor.
ix. 7, 1 Thess. ii. 17; φρεσίν, 1 Cor.
xiv. 20.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>in</em> the midst
of, <em>in</em> the performance of <em>your wicked
works</em>’; the same use of the preposition
as e.g. ii. 23, iv. 2.</p>

<p class='c034'>νυνί] Here, as frequently, νῦν
(νυνί) admits an aorist, because it denotes
not ‘at the present <em>moment</em>,’
but ‘in the present <em>dispensation</em>, the
present <em>order of things</em>’: comp. e.g.
ver. 26, Rom. v. 11, vii. 6, xi. 30, 31,
xvi. 26, Ephes. ii. 13, iii. 5, 2 Tim. i.
10, 1 Pet. i. 12, ii. 10, 25. In all
these passages there is a direct contrast
between the old dispensation
and the new, more especially as affecting
the relation of the Gentiles to
God. The aorist is found also in
Classical writers, where a similar contrast
is involved; e.g. Plato <cite>Symp.</cite>
193 A πρὸ τοῦ, ὥσπερ λέγω, ἓν ἦμεν·
νυνὶ δὲ διὰ τὴν ἀδικίαν διῳκίσθημεν ὑπὸ
τοῦ θεοῦ, Isæus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Cleon. her.</cite></span> 20 τότε
μὲν ... νυνὶ δὲ ... ἐβουλήθη.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀποκατηλλάγητε] The reasons for
preferring this reading, though the
direct authority for it is so slight, are
given in the detached note on the
various readings. But, whether ἀποκατηλλάγητε
or ἀποκατήλλαξεν be preferred,
the construction requires explanation.
If ἀποκατήλλαξεν be adopted,
it is perhaps best to treat
δὲ as introducing the apodosis, the
foregoing participial clause serving as
the protasis: ‘<em>And you, though ye were
once estranged ... yet now hath he
reconciled</em>,’ in which case the first
ὑμᾶς will be governed directly by ἀποκατήλλαξεν;
see Winer <cite>Gramm.</cite> § liii.
p. 553. If this construction be adopted,
παραστῆσαι ὑμᾶς will describe the result
of ἀποκατήλλαξεν, ‘so as <em>to present
you</em>’; but ὁ Θεὸς will still be the
nominative to ἀποκατήλλαξεν as in
2 Cor. v. 19. If on the other hand
ἀποκατηλλάγητε be taken, it is best to
regard νυνὶ δὲ ἀποκατηλλάγητε as a
direct indicative clause substituted
for the more regular participial form
νυνὶ δὲ ἀποκαταλλαγέντας for the sake
of greater emphasis: see the note on
ver. 26 τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον ... νῦν δὲ ἐφανερώθη.
In this case παραστῆσαι will
be governed directly by εὐδόκησεν,
and will itself govern ὑμα<sup>ς</sup> πότε ὄντας
κ.τ.λ., the second ὑμᾶς being a repetition
of the first; ‘<em>And you who
once were estranged ... but now ye have
been reconciled ... to present you</em>, I
say, <em>holy and without blemish</em>.’ For
the repetition of ὑμᾶς, which was
needed to disentangle the construction,
see the note on δι’ αὐτοῦ ver.
20.</p>

<p class='c034'>22. τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ] It has been supposed
that St Paul added these words,
which are evidently emphatic, with a
polemical aim either; (1) To combat
docetism. Of this form of error however
there is no direct evidence till a
somewhat later date: or (2) To combat
a false spiritualism which took
offence at the doctrine of an atoning
sacrifice. But for this purpose they
would not have been adequate, because
not explicit enough. It seems simpler
therefore to suppose that they were
added for the sake of greater clearness,
to distinguish the natural body
of Christ intended here from the
mystical body mentioned just above
ver. 18. Similarly in Ephes. ii. 14
ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ is used rather than
ἐν τῷ σώματι αὐτοῦ, because σῶμα
occurs in the context (ver. 16) of
Christ’s mystical body. The same
expression, τὸ σῶμα τῆς σαρκός, which
we have here, occurs also below, ii.
11, but with a different emphasis and
meaning. There the emphasis is on
τὸ σῶμα, the contrast lying between
the whole <em>body</em> and a single <em>member</em>
(see the note); whereas here τῆς σαρκὸς
is the emphatic part of the expression,
the antithesis being between
the <em>material</em> and the <em>spiritual</em>. Compare
also Ecclus. xxiii. 16 ἄνθρωπος
πόρνος ἐν σώματι σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ.</p>

<p class='c034'>Marcion omitted τῆς σαρκὸς as inconsistent
with his views, and explained
ἐν τῷ σώματι to mean the
Church. Hence the comment of
Tertullian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Marc.</cite></span> v. 19, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘utique

<p class='c033'>παραστῆσαι] If the construction

ἡμᾶς σὺν Ἰησοῦ ἐγερεῖ καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>παραστήσει</em>&nbsp;
σὺν ὑμῖν. This construction seems
in all respects preferable to connecting
παραστῆσαι directly with ἀποκατηλλάγητε
and interpreting the words,
<em>‘Ye have been reconciled so that ye
should present yourselves</em> (ὑμᾶς) ... <em>before
Him</em>.’   This latter interpretation
leaves the καὶ ὑμᾶς ποτὲ ὄντας κ.τ.λ.
without a government, and it gives to
the second ὑμᾶς a reflexive sense (as
if ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς or ἑαυτούς), which is at
least harsh.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀμώμους] <em>‘without blemish</em>’ rather
than ‘<em>without blame</em>,’ in the language
of the New Testament; see the noteon Ephes. i. 4. It is a sacrificial word,
like τέλειος, ὀλόκληρος, etc. The verb
παριστάναι also is used of presenting
a sacrifice in Rom. xii. 1 &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>παραστῆσαι</em>&nbsp;
τὰ σώματα ὑμῶν θυσίαν ζῶσαν ἁγίαν
κ.τ.λ., Lev. xvi. 7 (v. l.): comp. Luke
ii. 22.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀνεγκλήτους] an advance upon ἀμώμους,
‘in whom not only no blemish
is found, but against whom no charge
is brought’: comp. 1 Tim. vi. 14 ἄσπιλον,
ἀνεπίλημπτον. The word ἀνέγκλητος
occurs again in 1 Cor. i. 8,
1 Tim. iii. 10, Tit. i. 6, 7.</p>

<p class='c034'>κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ] ‘<em>before Him</em>,’ i.e.
‘Himself,’ as in the parallel passage,
Ephes. i. 4; if the construction here
adopted be correct. For this use of
the personal pronoun instead of the
reflexive see the note on εἰς αὐτόν,
ver. 20. But does κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ
refer to God’s future judgment or
His present approbation? The latter
seems more probable, both because
the expression certainly has this
meaning in the parallel passage, Ephes.
i. 4, and because κατενώπιαν, ἐνώπιον,
κατέναντι, etc., are commonly so used;
e.g. Rom. xiv. 22, 1 Cor. i. 29, 2
Cor. ii. 17, iv. 2, vii. 12, xii. 19,
etc. On the other hand, where the
future judgment is intended, a different
expression is found, 2 Cor. v.
10 ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ βήματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ.
Thus God is here regarded, not as the
judge who tries the accused, but as
the μωμοσκόπος who examines the
victims (Polyc. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phil.</cite></span> 4, see the note on
Ephes. i. 4). Compare Heb. iv. 12,
13 for a closely allied metaphor.
The passage in Jude 24, στῆσαι κατενώπιον
τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ἀμώμους ἐν
ἀγαλλιάσει, though perhaps referring
to final approval, is too different in
expression to influence the interpretation
of Paul’s language here.</p>

<p class='c034'>23. εἴ γε] On the force of these particles
see Gal. iii. 4. They express a
pure hypothesis in themselves, but
the indicative mood following converts
the hypothesis into a hope.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐπιμένετε] ‘<em>ye abide by, ye adhere
to</em>,’ with a dative; the common construction
of ἐπιμένειν in St Paul: see
the note on Phil. i. 24. In this connexion
τῇ πίστει is perhaps ‘<em>your</em>
faith,’ rather than ‘<em>the</em> faith.’</p>

<p class='c034'>τεθεμελιωμένοι κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>built on a
foundation and so firm</em>’; not like
the house of the foolish man in the
parable who built χωρὶς θεμελίου, Luke
vi. 49. For τεθεμελιωμένοι comp.

&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἥδρασεν</em>&nbsp; ἐπὶ τὸν ἀσφαλῆ τοῦ ἰδίου

the definitive article, though

with the best authorities. For the
meanings of πᾶσα κτίσις, πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις,
see the note on ver. 15. The expression
πᾶσα κτίσις must not be limited
to man.  The statement is given in

the hyperbole ἐν πάσῃ κτίσει compare
1 Thess. i. 8 ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ. To demand
statistical exactness in such a context
would be to require what is never required
in similar cases. The motive
of the Apostle here is at once to emphasize
the universality of the genuine
Gospel, which has been offered without
reserve to all alike, and to appeal
to its publicity, as the credential and
guarantee of its truth: see the notes

hardly be the assertion of his Apostolic

that this was questioned; otherwise
he would have declared his commission
in stronger terms. We can only
answer that impressed with the dignity
of his office, as involving the offer
of grace to the Gentiles, he cannot
refrain from magnifying it. At the
same time this mention enables him
to link himself in bonds of closer sympathy
with the Colossians, and he
passes on at once to his relations with
them: comp. Ephes. iii. 2–9, 1 Tim.

I cannot choose but rejoice
in my sufferings. Yes, I Paul
the persecutor, I Paul the feeble and
sinful, am permitted to supplement—I
do not shrink from the word—to
supplement the afflictions of Christ.
Despite all that He underwent, He the
Master has left something still for me
the servant to undergo. And so my
flesh is privileged to suffer for His
body—His spiritual body, the Church.
I was appointed a minister of the
Church, a steward in God’s household,
for this very purpose, that I might
administer my office on your behalf,
might dispense to you Gentiles the
stores which His bountiful grace has
provided. Thus I was charged to
preach without reserve the whole
Gospel of God, to proclaim the great
mystery which had remained a secret
through all the ages and all the generations
from the beginning, but which
now in these last times was revealed
to His holy people. For such was His
good pleasure. God willed to make
known to them, in all its inexhaustible
wealth thus displayed through the
call of the Gentiles, the glorious revelation
of this mystery—Christ not the
Saviour of the Jews only, but Christ
dwelling in <em>you</em>, Christ become to <em>you</em>
the hope of glory.’</p>

<p class='c034'>24. Νῦν χαίρω] A sudden outburst
of thanksgiving, that he, who was less
than the least, who was not worthy to
be called an Apostle, should be allowed
to share and even to supplement the
sufferings of Christ. The relative ὅς,
which is found in some authorities, is
doubtless the repetition of the final
syllable of δίακονος; but its insertion
would be assisted by the anxiety of
scribes to supply a connecting link
between the sentences. The genuine
reading is more characteristic of St
Paul. The abruptness, which dispenses
with a connecting particle, has
a parallel in Tim. i. 12 χάριν ἔχω τῷ
ἐνδυναμώσαντί με Χριστῷ κ.τ.λ., where
also the common text inserts a link of
connexion, καὶ χάριν ἔχω κ.τ.λ. Compare
also 2 Cor. vii. 9 νῦν χαίρω, οὐχ
ὅτι κ.τ.λ., where again there is no connecting
particle.</p>

<p class='c034'>The thought underlying νῦν seems
to be this: ‘If ever I have been disposed

my cross almost too heavy to bear,

the lavish wealth of God’s mercy—now

The meaning of ἀντὶ in this compound
will be plain from the passages quoted.
It signifies that the supply comes <em>from
an opposite quarter</em> to the deficiency.
This idea is more or less definitely expressed
in the context of all the passages,
in the words which are spaced.
The force of ἀνταναπληροῦν in St Paul
is often explained as denoting simply
that the supply <em>corresponds in extent</em>
to the deficiency. This interpretation
practically deprives ἀντί of
any meaning, for ἀναπληροῦν alone
would denote as much. If indeed the
supply had been the subject of the
verb, and the sentence had run τὰ
παθήματά μου ἀνταναπληροῖ τὰ ὑστηρήματα
κ.τ.λ., this idea might perhaps
be reached without sacrificing the
sense of ἀντί; but in such a passage
as this, where one personal agent is
mentioned in connexion with the supply
and another in connexion with
the deficiency, the one forming the
subject and the other being involved
in the object of the verb, the ἀντὶ can
only describe the correspondence of
these personal agents. So interpreted,
it is eminently expressive here. The
point of the Apostle’s boast is that
Christ the sinless Master should have
<em>left</em> something for Paul the unworthy
servant to suffer. The right idea has
been seized and is well expressed by
Photius <cite>Amphil.</cite> 121 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 709 Migne)
οὐ γὰρ ἁπλῶς φησιν Ἀναπληρῶ, ἀλλ’
Ἀνταναπληρῶ, τουτέστιν, Ἀντὶ δεσπότου
καὶ διδασκάλου ὁ δοῦλος ἐγὼ καὶ
μαθητὴς κ.τ.λ. Similar in meaning,
though not identical, is the expression
in 2 Cor. i. 5, where the sufferings
of Christ are said to ‘overflow’
(περισσεύειν) upon the Apostle. The
theological difficulty which this plain
and natural interpretation of ἀνταναπληροῦν
is supposed to involve will
be considered in the note on τῶν
θλίψεων.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὰ ὑστερήματα] ‘<em>the things lacking</em>.’
This same word ὑστέρημα ‘deficiency’
occurs with ἀναπληροῦν 1 Cor.
xvi. 17, Phil. ii. 30, and with προσαναπληροῦν
2 Cor. ix. 12, xi. 9. Its direct
opposite is περίσσευμα ‘abundance,
superfluity,’ 2 Cor. viii. 13, 14; comp.
Luke xxi. 4. Another interpretation,
which makes ὑστέρημα an antithesis
to προτέρημα, explaining it as ‘the later’
as opposed to the earlier ‘sufferings of
Christ,’ is neither supported by the
usage of the word nor consistent with
ἀνταναπληρῶ.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ] ‘<em>of the
afflictions of Christ</em>,’ i.e. which Christ
endured. This seems to be the only
natural interpretation of the words.
Others have explained them as meaning
‘the afflictions imposed by Christ,’
or ‘the afflictions endured for Christ’s
sake,’ or ‘the afflictions which resemble
those of Christ.’ All such
interpretations put a more or less
forced meaning on the genitive. All
alike ignore the meaning of ἀντὶ in
ἀνταναπληρῶ which points to a <em>distinction</em>
of persons suffering. Others
again suppose the words to describe
St Paul’s own afflictions regarded as
Christ’s, because Christ suffers in His
suffering Church; e.g. Augustine <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in
Psalm.</cite></span> cxlii. § 3 (<span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 1590) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Patitur,
inquit, adhuc Christus pressuram, non
in carne sua in qua ascendit in cælum,
sed in carne mea quæ adhuc laborat
in terra,’</span> quoting Gal. ii. 20. This
last is a very favourite explanation,
and has much to recommend it. It
cannot be charged with wresting the
meaning of αἱ θλίψεις τοῦ Χριστοῦ.
Moreover it harmonizes with St Paul’s
mode of speaking elsewhere. But, like
the others, it is open to the fatal objection
that it empties the first preposition
in ἀνταναπληρῶ of any force.
The central idea in this interpretation
is the <em>identification</em> of the suffering
Apostle with the suffering Christ,
whereas ἀνταναπληρῶ emphasizes the
<em>distinction</em> between the two. It is
therefore inconsistent with this context,
however important may be the
truth which it expresses.</p>

<p class='c034'>The theological difficulty, which
these and similar explanations are intended
to remove, is imaginary and
not real. There is a sense in which
it is quite legitimate to speak of
Christ’s afflictions as <em>incomplete</em>, a
sense in which they may be, and indeed
must be, <em>supplemented</em>. For
the sufferings of Christ may be considered
from two different points of
view. They are either <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>satisfactoriæ</em></span>
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ædificatoriæ</em></span>. They have their
sacrificial efficacy, and they have their
ministerial utility. (1) From the
former point of view the Passion of
Christ was the one full perfect and
sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction
for the sins of the whole
world. In this sense there could
be no ὑστέρημα of Christ’s sufferings;
for, Christ’s sufferings being different
<em>in kind</em> from those of His servants,
the two are incommensurable. But
in this sense the Apostle would surely
have used some other expression
such as τοῦ σταυροῦ (i. 20, Eph. ii.
16 etc.), or τοῦ θανάτου (i. 22, Rom.
v. 10, Heb. ii. 14, etc.), but hardly
τῶν θλίψεων. Indeed θλίψις, ‘affliction,’
is not elsewhere applied in
the New Testament in any sense
to Christ’s sufferings, and certainly
would not suggest a sacrificial act.
(2) From the latter point of view
it is a simple matter of fact that the
afflictions of every saint and martyr
do supplement the afflictions of
Christ. The Church is built up by
repeated acts of self-denial in successive
individuals and successive generations.
They continue the work which
Christ began. They bear their part
in the sufferings of Christ (2 Cor. i. 7
κοινωνοὶ τῶν παθημάτων, Phil. iii. 10
κοινωνίαν τῶν παθημάτων); but St Paul
would have been the last to say that
they bear their part in the atoning
sacrifice of Christ. This being so, St
Paul does not mean to say that his
own sufferings filled up all the ὑστερήματα,
but only that they <em>went towards</em>
filling them up. The present
tense ἀνταναπληρῶ denotes an inchoate,
and not a complete act. These
ὑστερήματα will never be fully supplemented,
until the struggle of the
Church with sin and unbelief is
brought to a close.</p>

<p class='c034'>Thus the idea of expiation or satisfaction
is wholly absent from this
passage; and with it is removed the
twofold temptation which has beset
theologians of opposite schools. (1)
On the one hand Protestant commentators,
rightly feeling that any interpretation
which infringed the completeness
of the work wrought by
Christ’s death must be wrong, because
it would make St Paul contradict
himself on a cardinal point of his
teaching, have been tempted to wrest
the sense of the words. They have
emptied ἀνταναπληρῶ of its proper
force; or they have assigned a false
meaning to ὑστερήματα; or they have
attached a non-natural sense to the
genitive τοῦ Χριστοῦ. (2) On the
other hand Romanist commentators,
while protesting (as they had a right
to do) against these methods of interpretation,
have fallen into the opposite
error. They have found in this passage
an assertion of the merits of the
saints, and (as a necessary consequence)
of the doctrine of indulgences.
They have not observed that,
if the idea of vicarious satisfaction
comes into the passage at all, the satisfaction
of St Paul is represented here
as the same in kind with the satisfaction
of Christ, however different it may
be in degree; and thus they have truly
exposed themselves to the reproach
which Estius indignantly repudiates
on their behalf, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quasi Christus non
satis passus sit ad redemptionem nostram,
ideoque supplemento martyrum
opus habeat; quod impium est sentire,
quodque Catholicos dicere non
minus impie calumniantur hæretici.’</span>
It is no part of a commentator here
to enquire generally whether the Roman
doctrine of the satisfaction of the
saints can in any way be reconciled
with St Paul’s doctrine of the satisfaction
of Christ. It is sufficient to
say that, so far as regards this particular
passage, the Roman doctrine
can only be imported into it at the
cost of a contradiction to the Pauline
doctrine. It is only fair to add however
that Estius himself says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quæ
quidem doctrina, etsi Catholica et
Apostolica sit, atque aliunde satis
probetur, ex hoc tamen Apostoli loco
nobis non videtur admodum solide
statui posse.’</span> But Roman Catholic
commentators generally find this
meaning in the text, as may be seen
from the notes of à Lapide.</p>

see the note on Ephes. i. 10; for
the latter sense, which it has here,
compare 1 Cor. ix. 17 οἰκονομίαν πεπίστευμαι,

<p class='c033'>εἰς ὑμᾶς] ‘<em>to youward</em>,’ i.e. ‘for

μοι, as in Ephes. iii. 2 τὴν οἰκονομίαν

Ἰησοῦ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>εἰς τὰ ἔθνη</em>&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='c034'>πληρῶσαι] ‘<em>to fulfil</em>,’ i.e. ‘to preach
fully,’ ‘to give its complete development
to’; as Rom. xv. 19 ὥστε με
ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ κύκλῳ μέχρι τοῦ
Ἰλλυρικοῦ πεπληρωκέναι τὸ εὐαγγελίον
τοῦ Χριστοῦ. Thus ‘the word of
God’ here is ‘the Gospel,’ as in most
places (1 Cor. xiv. 36, 2 Cor. ii. 17, iv.
2, etc.), though not always (e.g. Rom.
ix. 6), in St Paul, as also in the Acts.
The other interpretation, ‘to accomplish
the promise of God,’ though
suggested by such passages as 1 Kings
ii. 27 πληρωθῆναι τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου,
2 Chron. xxxvi. 21 πληρωθῆναι λόγον
Κυρίου, etc., is alien to the context
here.</p>

<p class='c034'>26. τὸ μυστήριον] This is not the
only term borrowed from the ancient
mysteries, which St Paul employs to
describe the teaching of the Gospel.
The word τέλειον just below, ver. 28,
seems to be an extension of the same
metaphor. In Phil. iv. 12 again we
have the verb μεμύημαι: and in Ephes.
i. 14 σφραγίζεσθαι is perhaps an image
derived from the same source. So
too the Ephesians are addressed as
Παύλου συμμύσται in Ign. <cite>Ephes.</cite> 12.
The Christian teacher is thus regarded
as a ἱεροφάντης (see Epict. iii. 21.
13 sq.) who initiates his disciples into
the rites. There is this difference
however; that, whereas the heathen
mysteries were strictly confined to a
narrow circle, the Christian mysteries
are freely communicated to all. There
is therefore an intentional paradox in
the employment of the image by St
Paul. See the notes on πάντα ἄνθρωπον
τέλειον below.</p>

<p class='c034'>Thus the idea of <em>secresy</em> or <em>reserve</em>
disappears when μυστήριον is adopted
into the Christian vocabulary by St
Paul: and the word signifies simply
‘a truth which was once hidden but
now is revealed,’ ‘a truth which without
special revelation would have been
unknown.’ Of the nature of the truth
itself the word says nothing. It may
be transcendental, incomprehensible,
mystical, mysterious, in the modern
sense of the term (1 Cor. xv. 51, Eph.
v. 32): but this idea is quite accidental,
and must be gathered from the
special circumstances of the case, for
it cannot be inferred from the word
itself. Hence μυστήριον is almost
universally found in connexion with
words denoting revelation or publication;
e.g. ἀποκαλύπτειν, ἀποκάλυψις,
Rom. xvi. 25, Ephes. iii. 3, 5, 2 Thess.
ii. 7; γνωρίζειν Rom. xvi. 26, Ephes. i.
9, iii. 3, 10, vi. 19; φανεροῦν Col. iv. 3,
Rom. xvi. 26, 1 Tim. iii. 16; λαλεῖν iv.
3, 1 Cor. ii. 7, xiv. 2; λέγειν, 1 Cor.
xv. 51.</p>

<p class='c034'>But the one special ‘mystery’ which
absorbs St Paul’s thoughts in the
Epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians
is the free admission of the
Gentiles on equal terms to the privileges
of the covenant. For this he
is a prisoner; this he is bound to
proclaim fearlessly (iv. 3, Ephes. vi.
19); this, though hidden from all time,
was communicated to him by a special
revelation (Ephes. iii. 3 sq.); in this had
God most signally displayed the lavish
wealth of His goodness (ver. 27, ii.
2 sq., Ephes. i. 6 sq., iii. 8 sq.). In one
passage only throughout these two
epistles is μυστήριον applied to anything
else, Ephes. v. 32. The same
idea of the μυστήριον appears very
prominently also in the thanksgiving
(added apparently later than the rest
of the letter) at the end of the Epistle
to the Romans, xvi. 25 sq. μυστηρίου ...
εἰς ὑπακοὴν πίστεως εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη
γνωρισθέντος.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῶν γενεῶν] An αἲων is made up of
many γενεαί; comp. Ephes. iii. 21 εἰς
πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶνος τῶν αἰώνων,
Is. li. 9 ὡς γενεὰ αἰῶνος (where
the Hebrew has the plural ‘generations’).
Hence the order here.
Not only was this mystery unknown
in remote periods of antiquity, but
even in recent generations. It came
upon the world as a sudden surprise.
The moment of its revelation was the
moment of its fulfilment.</p>

<p class='c034'>27. ἠθέλησεν] ‘<em>willed</em>,’ ‘<em>was pleased</em>.’
It was God’s grace: it was no merit
of their own. See the note on i. 1
διὰ θελήματος Θεοῦ.</p>

<p class='c034'>νῦν δὲ κ.τ.λ.] An indicative clause
is substituted for a participial, which
would otherwise have been more natural,
for the sake of emphasizing the
statement; comp. ver. 22 νυνὶ δὲ ἀποκατηλλάγητε,
and see Winer § lxiii. p. 717.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸ πλοῦτος] The ‘<em>wealth</em> of God,’
as manifested in His dispensation of
grace, is a prominent idea in these
epistles; comp. ii. 2, Ephes. i. 7, 18,
iii. 8, 16; comp. Rom. xi. 33. See
above p. 43 sq. St Paul uses the
neuter and the masculine forms indifferently
in these epistles (e.g. τὸ
πλοῦτος Ephes. i. 7, ὁ πλοῦτος Ephes.
i. 18), as in his other letters (e.g. τὸ
πλοῦτος 2 Cor. viii. 2, ὁ πλοῦτος Rom.
ix. 23). In most passages however
there are various readings. On the
neuter forms τὸ πλοῦτος, τὸ ζῆλος, etc.,
see Winer § ix. p. 76.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῆς δόξης] i.e. ‘of the glorious
manifestation.’ This word in Hellenistic
Greek is frequently used of a
bright light; e.g. Luke ii. 9 περίελαμψεν,
Acts xxii. 11 τοῦ φωτός, 1 Cor.
xv. 41 ἡλίου, σελήνης, etc. 2 Cor. iii. 7
τοῦ προσώπου [Μωυσέως]. Hence it
is applied generally to a divine <em>manifestation</em>,
even where there is no physical
accompaniment of light; and
more especially to the revelation of
God in Christ (e.g. Joh. i. 14, 2 Cor.
iv. 4, etc.). The expression πλοῦτος
τῆς δόξης occurs again, Rom. ix. 23,
Ephes. i. 18, iii. 16. See above ver.

<p class='c033'>ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν] i.e. ‘as exhibited
among the Gentiles.’ It was just
here that this ‘mystery,’ this dispensation
of grace, achieved its greatest
triumphs and displayed its transcendant
glory; φαίνεται μὲν γὰρ καὶ ἐν ἑτεροις,
writes Chrysostom, πολλῷ δὲ
πλέον ἐν τούτοις ἡ πολλὴ τοῦ μυστερίου
δόξα. Here too was its <em>wealth</em>; for
it overflowed all barriers of caste or
race. Judaism was ‘beggarly’ (Gal.
iv. 9) in comparison, since its treasures
sufficed only for a few.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὅ ἐστιν] The antecedent is probably
τοῦ μυστηρίου; comp. ii. 2 τοῦ
μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ, Χριστοῦ ἐν ᾧ εἰσιν
πάντες κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν] ‘<em>Christ in you</em>,’
i.e. ‘you Gentiles.’ Not Christ, but
Christ given freely to the Gentiles,
is the ‘mystery’ of which St Paul
speaks; see the note on μυστήριον
above. Thus the various reading, ὃς
for ὅ, though highly supported, interferes
with the sense. With Χριστὸς
ἐν ὑμῖν compare μεθ’ ἡμῶν Θεός Matt.
i. 23. It may be a question however,
whether ἐν ὑμῖν means ‘<em>within you</em>’
or ‘<em>among you</em>.’ The former is perhaps
the more probable interpretation,
as suggested by Rom. viii. 10,
2 Cor. xiii. 5, Gal. iv. 19; comp.
Ephes. iii. 17 κατοικῆσαι τὸν Χριστὸν

Philad.</cite> 5, etc., applied to our Lord.</p>

<p class='c034'>28, 29. ‘This Christ we, the Apostles
and Evangelists, proclaim without
distinction and without reserve.
We know no restriction either of
persons or of topics. We admonish
every man and instruct every man.
We initiate every man in all the mysteries
of wisdom. It is our single
aim to present every man fully and
perfectly taught in Christ. For this
end I train myself in the discipline of
self-denial; for this end I commit myself
to the arena of suffering and toil,
putting forth in the conflict all that
energy which He inspires, and which
works in me so powerfully.’</p>

<p class='c034'>28. ἡμεῖς] ‘<em>we</em>,’ the preachers; the
same opposition as in 1 Cor. iv. 8, 10,
ix. 11, 2 Cor. xiii. 5 sq., 1 Thess. ii.
13 sq., etc. The Apostle hastens, as
usual, to speak of the part which he

magnify his office. See the next note,

<p class='c034'>νουθετοῦντες] ‘<em>admonishing</em>.’ The

complementary aspects of the

<p class='c034'>πάντα ἄνθρωπον] three times repeated
for the sake of emphasizing
the <em>universality</em> of the Gospel. This
great truth, for which St Paul gave
his life, was now again endangered
by the doctrine of an intellectual exclusiveness
taught by the Gnosticizers
at Colossæ, as before it had been
endangered by the doctrine of a
ceremonial exclusiveness taught by
the Judaizers in Galatia. See above
pp. 77, 92, 98 sq. For the repetition
of πάντα compare especially 1 Cor. x.
1 sq., where πάντες is five times, and
<em>ib.</em> xii. 29, 30, where it is seven times
repeated; see also Rom. ix. 6, 7, xi.
32, 1 Cor. xii. 13, xiii. 7, xiv. 31, etc.
Transcribers have been offended at
this characteristic repetition here, and
consequently have omitted πάντα ἄνθρωπον
in one place or other.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ] The Gnostic spoke
of a blind faith for the many, of a
higher γνῶσις for the few. St Paul
declares that the fullest wisdom is
offered to all alike. The character of
the teaching is as free from restriction,
as are the qualifications of the recipients.

also in 2 Pet. i. 16 &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐπόπται</em>&nbsp; γενηθέντες
τῆς ἐκείνου μεγαλειότητος we seem to
have the same metaphor. As an illustration
it may be mentioned that
Plato and Aristotle called the higher
philosophy ἐποπτικόν, because those
who have transcended the bounds
of the material, οἷον ἐντελῆ [l. ἐν τελετῇ]
τέλος ἔχειν φιλοσοφίαν [φιλοσοφίας]
νομίζουσι, Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> 382 <span class='fss'>D</span>, <span class='fss'>E</span>.
For other metaphorical expressions
in St Paul, derived from the mysteries,
see above on μυστήριον ver. 26.
Influenced probably by this heathen
use of τέλειος, the early Christians
applied it to the baptized, as opposed
to the catechumens: e.g. Justin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial.</cite></span>
8 (p. 225 <span class='fss'>C</span>) πάρεστιν ἐπιγνόντι σοι τὸν
Χριστὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τελείῳ γενομένῳ
εὐδαιμονεῖν, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> iii. 29 ὑποχωρεῖν
μοι κελεύσας, ὡς μήπω εἰληφότι τὸ

ἔφη κ.τ.λ., xi. 36 βαπτίσας ... ἤδη
λοιπὸν τέλειον ὄντα κ.τ.λ.; and for
later writers see Suicer <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Thes.</cite></span> s. vv. τελειόω,
τελείωσις. At all events we
may ascribe to its connexion with the
mysteries the fact that it was adopted
by Gnostics at a later date, and most
probably by the Gnosticizers at this
time, to distinguish the possessors of
the higher γνῶσις from the vulgar
herd of believers: see the passages
quoted in the note on Phil. iii. 15.
While employing the favourite Gnostic
term, the Apostle strikes at the root
of the Gnostic doctrine. The language
descriptive of the heathen mysteries
is transferred by him to the
Christian dispensation, that he may
thus more effectively contrast the
things signified. The true Gospel also
has its mysteries, its hierophants, its
initiation: but these are open to all
alike. In Christ every believer is τέλειος,
for he has been admitted as
ἐπόπτης of its most profound, most
awful, secrets. See again the note
on ἀπόκρυφοι, ii. 3.</p>

<p class='c034'>κοπιῶ] This word is used especially
of the labour undergone by the
athlete in his training, and therefore
fitly introduces the metaphor of ἀγωνιζόμενος:

ἀγωνίζεσθαι, are only found in St

Hebrews) in the New Testament.

<p class='c033'>II. 1–3. ‘I spoke of an <em>arena</em> and
a <em>conflict</em> in describing my apostolic
labours. The image was not lightly
chosen. I would have you know that my
care is not confined to my own direct
and personal disciples. I wish you to
understand the magnitude of the
struggle, which my anxiety for you
costs me—for you and for your neighbours
of Laodicea and for all who,
like yourselves, have never met me
face to face in the flesh. I am constantly
wrestling in spirit, that the
hearts of all such may be confirmed
and strengthened in the faith; that
they may be united in love; that they
may attain to all the unspeakable
wealth which comes from the firm
conviction of an understanding mind,
may be brought to the perfect knowledge
of God’s mystery, which is nothing
else than Christ—Christ containing
in Himself all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge hidden away.’</p>

<p class='c034'>1. Θέλω κ.τ.λ.] as in 1 Cor. xi. 3.
The corresponding negative form, οὐ
θέλω [θέλομεν] ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν, is the more
common expression in St Paul; Rom.
i. 13, xi. 25, 1 Cor. x. 1, xii. 1, 2 Cor.
i. 8, 1 Thess. iv. 13.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀγῶνα] The arena of the contest to
which ἀγωνιζόμενος in the preceding
verse refers may be either outward or
inward. It will include the ‘fightings
without,’ as well as the ‘fears within.’
Here however the inward struggle,
the wrestling in prayer, is the predominant
idea, as in iv. 12 πάντοτε ἀγωνιζόμενος
ὑπὲρ ὑμων ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς
ἵνα σταθῆτε κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ] The Laodiceans
were exposed to the same doctrinal
perils as the Colossians: see above
pp. 2, 41 sq. The Hierapolitans are
doubtless included in καὶ ὅσοι κ.τ.λ.
(comp. iv. 13), but are not mentioned
here by name, probably because they
were less closely connected with Colossæ
(see iv. 15 sq.), and perhaps also
because the danger was less threatening
there.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ ὅσοι κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>and all who</em>, like
yourselves, <em>have not seen</em>, etc.’; where
the καὶ ὅσοι introduces the whole class
to which the persons previously enumerated
belong; so Acts iv. 6 Ἄννας
ὁ ἀρχιερὲυς καὶ Καΐαφας καὶ Ἴωαννης καὶ
Ἀλέξανδρος &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>καὶ ὅσοι</em>&nbsp; ἦσαν ἐκ γένους

καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἐπὶ τόπον πλέων καὶ
ναῦται &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>καὶ ὅσοι</em>&nbsp; τὴν θάλασσαν ἐργάζονται.
Even a simple καὶ will sometimes
introduce the general after the particular,
e.g. Acts v. 29 ὁ Πέτρος καὶ οἱ
ἀπόστολοι, Ar. <cite>Nub.</cite> 413 ἐν Ἀθηναίοις
καὶ τοῖς Ἕλλησι, etc.; see Kühner
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Gramm.</cite></span> § 521, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 791. On the other
hand καὶ ὅσοι, occurring in an enumeration,
sometimes introduces a different
class from those previously mentioned,
as e.g. in Herod, vii. 185. As a pure
grammatical question therefore it is
uncertain whether St Paul’s language
here implies his personal acquaintance
with his correspondents or the contrary.
But in all such cases the sense
of the context must be our guide.
In the present instance καὶ ὅσοι is
quite out of place, unless the Colossians
and Laodiceans also were personally
unknown to the Apostle. There
would be no meaning in singling
out <em>individuals</em> who were known to
him, and then mentioning comprehensively
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>all</em></span> who were unknown to
him: see above p. 28, note <a href='#f84'>84</a>. Hence
we may infer from the expression
here, that St Paul had never visited
Colossæ–an inference which has been
already shown (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a> sq.) to accord
both with the incidental language of
this epistle elsewhere and with the
direct historical narrative of the Acts.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἑώρακαν] For this ending of the 3rd
pers. plur. perfect in -αν see Winer
§ xiii. p. 90. The received text reads
ἑωράκασι. In this passage the ω form
has the higher support; but below
in ver. 18 the preponderance of authority
favours ἑόρακεν rather than
ἑώρακεν. On the use of the form in ο

expressed; see ver. 5.</p>

<p class='c034'>αὐτῶν] where we should expect
ὑμῶν, but the substitution of the third
person for the second is suggested by
the immediately preceding καὶ ὅσοι.
This substitution confirms the interpretation
of καὶ ὅσοι already given.
Unless the Colossians are included in
ὅσοι, they must be excluded by αὐτῶν.
Yet this exclusion is hardly conceivable
in such a context.</p>

<p class='c034'>συμβιβασθέντες] ‘<em>they being united</em>,
<em>compacted</em>,’ for συμβιβάζειν must here
have its common meaning, as it has
elsewhere in this and the companion
epistle: ver. 19 διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ
συνδέσμων ... συμβιβαζόμενον, Ephes. iv.
16 πᾶν τὸ σῶμα συναρμολογούμενον καὶ
συμβιβαζόμενον. Otherwise we might
be disposed to assign to this verb here
the sense which it always bears in the
<span class='fss'>LXX</span> (e.g. in Is. xl. 13, 14, quoted
in 1 Cor. ii. 16), ‘instructed, taught,’
as it is rendered in the Vulgate. Its
usage in the Acts is connected with
this latter sense; e.g. ix. 22 συμβιβάζων
‘proving,’ xvi. 10 συμβιβάζοντες ‘concluding’;
and so in xix. 33 συνεβίβασαν
Ἀλέξανδρον (the best supported
reading) can only mean ‘instructed
Alexander.’ For the different sense
of the nominative absolute see the
note on iii. 16. The received text
substitutes συμβιβασθέντων here.
`
ἐν ἀγάπῃ] for love is the σύνδεσμος
(iii. 14) of perfection.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ εἰς] ‘<em>and brought unto</em>,’ the
thought being supplied from the preceding
συμβιβασθέντες, which involves
an idea of motion, comp. Joh. xx. 7
ἐντετυλιγμένον εἰς ἕνα τόπον.</p>

<p class='c034'>πᾶν πλοῦτος] This reading is better
supported than either πᾶν τὸ πλοῦτος
or πάντα πλοῦτον, while, as the intermediate
reading, it also explains the
other two.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῆς πληροφορίας] ‘<em>the full assurance</em>,’
for such seems to be the
meaning of the substantive wherever
it occurs in the New Testament; 1
Thess. i. 5 ἐν πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ, Heb.
vi. 11 πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος,
x. 22 ἐν πληροφορίᾳ πίστεως, comp.
Clem. Rom. 42 μετὰ πληροφορίας πνεύματος
ἁγίου. With the exception of
1 Thess. i. 5 however, all the Biblical
passages might bear the other sense
‘fulness’: see Bleek on Heb. vi. 11.
For the verb see the note on πεπληροφορημένοι
below, iv. 12.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐπίγνωσιν] See the note on i. 9.</p>

<p class='c034'>τοῦ μυστηρίου κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>the mystery
of God</em>, even <em>Christ in whom</em>, etc.,’
Χριστοῦ being in apposition with τοῦ
μυστηρίου; comp. i. 27 τοῦ μυστηρίου
τούτου ... ὅ ἐστιν Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν, 1 Tim.
iii. 16 τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον, Ὅς
ἐφανερώθη κ.τ.λ. The reasons for adopting
the reading τοῦ Θεοῦ Χριστοῦ are
given in the detached note on various
readings. Other interpretations of this
reading are; (1) ‘the God Christ,’
taking Χριστοῦ in apposition with
Θεοῦ; or (2) ‘the God of Christ,’
making it the genitive after Θεοῦ:
but both expressions are without a
parallel in St Paul. The mystery
here is not ‘Christ,’ but ‘Christ as
containing in Himself all the treasures
of wisdom’; see the note on i. 27
Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν. For the form of the
sentence comp. Ephes. iv. 15, 16 ἡ κεφαλή,
Χριστὸς ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>3. πάντες] So πᾶν πλοῦτος ver. 2,
πάσῃ σοφίᾳ ii. 28. These repetitions
serve to emphasize the character of
the Gospel, which is as complete in
itself, as it is universal in its application.</p>

<p class='c033'>σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως] The two words
occur together again Rom. xi. 33 ὦ
βάθος πλούτου καὶ σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως
Θεοῦ, 1 Cor. xii. 8. They are found
in conjunction also several times
in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> of Eccles. i. 7, 16, 18, ii.
21, 26, ix. 10, where <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חבכוה</span> is represented
by σοφία and <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">דעת</span> by γνῶσις.
While γνῶσις is simply <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>intuitive</em></span>,
σοφία is <em>ratiocinative</em> also. While
γνῶσις applies chiefly to the apprehension
of truths, σοφία superadds the
power of reasoning about them and
tracing their relations. When Bengel
on 1 Cor. xii. 8 sq. says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Cognitio
[γνῶσις] est quasi visus; sapientia
[σοφία] visus cum sapore,’</span> he is so
far right; but when he adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘cognitio,
rerum agendarum; sapientia, rerum
aeternarum,’</span> he is quite wide of
the mark. Substantially the same,
and equally wrong, is St Augustine’s
distinction <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> xii. 20, 25 (<span class='fss'>VIII.</span>
pp. 923, 926) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘intelligendum est ad
contemplationem sapientiam [σοφίαν],

... quod alia [σοφία] sit intellectualis
cognitio aeternarum rerum, alia

directly opposed to usage. In Aristotle
<cite>Eth. Nic.</cite> i. 1 γνῶσις is opposed
to πρᾶξις. In St Paul it is connected
with the apprehension of eternal mysteries,
1 Cor. xiii. 2 εἰδῶ τὰ μυστήρια
πάντα καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γνῶσιν. On
the relation of σοφία to σύνεσις see

<p class='c034'>ἀπόκρυφοι] So 1 Cor. ii. 7 λαλοῦμεν
Θεοῦ σοφίαν ἐν μυστηρίῳ, τὴν ἀποκεκρυμμένην.
As before in τέλειος
(i. 28), so here again in ἀπόκρυφοι the
Apostle adopts  a favourite term of
the Gnostic teachers, only that he may
refute a favourite doctrine.  The word
<em>apocrypha</em> was especially applied to
those  esoteric  writings, for which
such sectarians claimed an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>auctoritas
secreta</em></span> (Aug. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Faust.</cite></span> xi. 2, <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> p.
219) and which they carefully guarded
from publication after the manner of
their Jewish prototypes the Essenes
(see above p. 89 sq.): comp. Iren. i.
20. 1 ἀμύθητον πλῆθος ἀποκρύφων καὶ
νόθων γραφῶν, Clem. Alex. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> i.

τοῦδε οἱ τὴν Προδίκου μετιόντες

(p. 524) ἐρρύη δὲ αὐτοῖς τὸ δόγμα ἔκ
τινος ἀποκρύφου. See also the application
of the text Prov. ix. 17 ἄρτων
κρυφίων ἡδέως ἅψασθε to these heretics
in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> i. 19 (p. 375). Thus the word
<em>apocrypha</em> in the first instance was
an honourable appellation applied by
the heretics themselves to their esoteric
doctrine and their secret books;
but owing to the general character
of these works the term, as adopted
by orthodox writers, got to signify
‘false,’ ‘spurious.’   The early fathers
never apply it, as it is now applied,
to <em>deutero-canonical</em> writings,   but
confine it to <em>supposititious</em> and <em>heretical</em>
works: see Smith’s <cite>Dictionary
of the Bible</cite> s.v. In the text St
Paul uses it καταχρηστικῶς, as he uses
μυστήριον. ‘All the richest treasures
of that secret wisdom,’ he would say,
‘on which you lay so much stress,
are buried in Christ, and being buried
there are accessible to all alike who
seek Him.’ But, while the term ἀπόκρυφος
is adopted because it was
used to designate the secret doctrine
and writings of the heretics, it is also
entirely in keeping with the metaphor
of the ‘treasure’; e.g. Is. xlv. 3 δώσω
σοι θησαυροὺς σκοτεινοὺς ἀποκρύφους,
1 Macc. i. 23 ἔλαβε τοὺς θησαυροὺς
τοὺς ἀποκρύφους, Dan. xi. 43 ἐν τοῖς
ἀποκρύφοις τοῦ χρυσοῦ καὶ τοῦ αργύρου:
comp. Matt. xiii. 44.</p>

<p class='c034'>The stress thus laid on ἀπόκρυφοι
will explain its position. It is not
connected with εἰσιν, but must be
taken apart as a secondary predicate:
comp. ver. 10 ἐστὲ ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι,
iii. 1 οὗ ὁ Χριστός ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ
τοῦ Θεοῦ καθήμενος, James i. 17 πᾶν

κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>4–7. ‘I do not say this without a
purpose. I wish to warn you against
any who would lead you astray by
specious argument and persuasive
rhetoric. For I am not an indifferent
spectator of your doings. Although
I am absent from you in my flesh, yet
I am present with you in my spirit.
I rejoice to behold the orderly array
and the solid phalanx which your faith
towards Christ presents against the
assaults of the foe. I entreat you
therefore not to abandon the Christ,
as you learnt from Epaphras to know
Him, even Jesus the Lord, but to walk
still in Him as heretofore. I would
have you firmly rooted once for all in
Him. I desire to see you built up
higher in Him day by day, to see you
growing ever stronger and stronger
through your faith, while you remain
true to the lessons taught you of old,
so that you may abound in it, and thus
abounding may pour forth your hearts
in gratitude to God the giver of all.’</p>

against which St Paul here contends
professed to be a φιλοσοφία (ver. 8)
and had a λόγον σοφίας (ver. 23).</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν πιθανολογίᾳ] The words πιθανολογεῖν
(Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eth. Nic.</cite></span> i. 1), πιθανολογία
(Plat. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Theæt.</cite></span> 162 <span class='fss'>E</span>), πιθανολογικός
(Epictet. i. 8. 7), occur occasionally
in classical writers, but do not
bear a bad sense, being most frequently
opposed to ἀπόδειξις, as probable
argument to strict mathematical
demonstration. This contrast probably
suggested St Paul’s language in
1 Cor. ii. 4 οὐκ ἐν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>πειθοῖς</em>&nbsp; σοφίας &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>λόγοις</em>&nbsp;
ἀλλ’ ἐν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀποδείξει</em>&nbsp; πνεύματος
κ.τ.λ., and may possibly have been
present to his mind here.</p>

<p class='c034'>5. ἀλλὰ] frequently introduces the
apodosis after εἰ or εἰ καὶ in St Paul;
e.g. Rom. vi. 5, 1 Cor. ix. 2, 2 Cor. iv.
16, v. 16, xi. 6, xiii. 4 (v. l.).</p>

<p class='c034'>τῷ πνεύματι] ‘<em>in my spirit</em>’, not
‘<em>by the Spirit</em>’. We have here the
common antithesis of flesh and spirit,
or body and spirit: comp. 1 Cor. v. 3
ἀπὼν τῷ σώματι, παρὼν δὲ τῷ πνεύματι.
St Paul elsewhere uses another antithesis,
προσώπῳ and καρδίᾳ, to express
this same thing; 1 Thess. ii. 17.</p>

<p class='c034'>χαίρων καὶ βλέπων] ‘<em>rejoicing and
beholding</em>’. This must not be regarded
as a logical inversion. The contemplation
of their orderly array, though
it might have been first the cause,
was afterwards the consequence, of
the Apostle’s rejoicing. He looked,
because it gave him satisfaction to
look.</p>

τάξιν τε καὶ φυλακὰς καὶ κόσμον αὐτῶν
καὶ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς στρατοπεδείας ἐθαύμασε.
The enforced companionship
of St Paul with the soldiers of the
prætorian guard at this time (Phil. i.
13) might have suggested this image.
At all events in the contemporary
epistle (Ephes. vi. 14 sq.) we have an
elaborate metaphor from the armour
of a soldier.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸ στερέωμα] ‘<em>solid front</em>, <em>close
phalanx</em>’, a continuation of the metaphor:
comp. 1 Macc. ix. 14 εἶδεν
Ἰούδας ὅτι Βακχίδης καὶ τὸ στερέωμα
τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἐν τοῖς δεξιοῖς. Somewhat
similar are the expressions στερεοῦν
τὸν πόλεμον 1 Macc. x. 50, κατὰ
τὴν στερέωσιν τῆς μάχης Ecclus. xxviii.
10. For the connexion here compare
1 Pet. v. 9 ἀντίστητε στερεοὶ τῇ πίστει,
Acts xvi. 5 ἐστερεοῦντο τῇ πίστει.</p>

<p class='c034'>6. ὡς οὖν παρελάβετε κ.τ.λ.] i.e.
‘Let your conviction and conduct be
in perfect accordance with the doctrines
and precepts of the Gospel as
it was taught to you’. For this use
of παρελάβετε ‘ye received from your
teachers, were instructed in’, comp.
1 Cor. xv. 1, 3, Gal. i. 9, Phil. iv. 9,
1 Thess. ii. 13, iv. 1, 2 Thess. iii. 6.
The word παραλαμβάνειν implies either
‘to receive as transmitted’, or ‘to receive
for transmission’: see the note
on Gal. i. 12. The ὡς of the protasis
suggests a οὕτως in the apodosis, which
in this case is unexpressed but must
be understood. The meaning of ὡς
παρελάβετε here is explained by the
καθὼς ἐμάθετε ἀπὸ Ἐπαφρᾶ in i. 7; see
the note there, and comp. below ver. 7
καθὼς ἐδιδάχθητε.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸν Χριστόν] ‘<em>the Christ</em>’, rather
than ‘the Gospel’, because the central
point in the Colossian heresy was the
subversion of the true idea of the
Christ.</p>

<p class='c034'>Ἰησοῦν τὸν Κύριον] ‘even <em>Jesus the
Lord</em>’, in whom the true conception
of the Christ is realised: comp. Ephes.
iv. 20, 21, ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἐμάθετε
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τὸν Χριστόν</em>&nbsp;, εἴγε αὐτὸν ἠκούσατε καὶ
ἐν αὐτῷ ἐδιδάχθητε, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια
ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</em>&nbsp;, where the same
idea is more directly expressed. The
genuine doctrine of the Christ consists
in (1) the recognition of the historical
person <em>Jesus</em>, and (2) the acceptance
of Him as <em>the Lord</em>. This
doctrine was seriously endangered by
the mystic theosophy of the false
teachers. The same order which we
have here occurs also in Ephes. iii. 11
ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἡμῶν
(the correct reading).</p>

<p class='c034'>7. ἐρριζωμένοι] Two points may
be noticed here; (1) The expressive
change of tenses; ἐρριζωμένοι ‘firmly
rooted’ <em>once for all</em>, ἐποικοδομούμενοι,
βεβαιούμενοι, ‘built up and strengthened’
<em>from hour to hour</em>. (2) The
rapid transition of metaphor, περιπατεῖτε,
ἐρῥιζωμένοι, ἐποικοδομούμενοι,
the path, the tree, the building: comp.
Ephes. iii. 17 ἐρριζωμένοι καὶ τεθεμελιωμένοι.
The metaphors of the plant
and the building occur together in
1 Cor. iii. 9 Θεοῦ γεώργιον, Θεοῦ οἰκοδομή.
The transition in this passage
is made easier by the fact that ῥιζοῦν
(Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> 321 <span class='fss'>D</span>), ἐκριζοῦν (Jer. i. 10,
1 Macc. v. 51), πρόρριζος (Jos. <cite>B.J.</cite>
vii. 8. 7), etc., are not uncommonly
used of cities and buildings.</p>

<a href='#Page_244'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>ἐποικοδομούμενοι] ‘<em>being built up</em>,’
as in 1 Cor. iii. 10–14. After this
verb we might have expected ἐπ’
αὐτῷ or ἐπ’ αὐτόν (1 Cor. iii. 12)
rather than ἐν αὐτῷ; but in this
and the companion epistle Christ is
represented rather as the binding
element than as the foundation of the
building: e.g. Ephes. ii. 20 ἐποικοδομηθέντες
ἐπὶ τῷ θεμελίῳ τῶν ἀποστόλων
καὶ προφητῶν, ὄντος &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀκρογωνιαίου</em>&nbsp;

&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐν</em>&nbsp; ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς συνοικοδομεῖσθε. The
ἐπὶ in ἐποικοδομεῖν does not necessarily
refer to the original foundation,
but may point to the continued progress
of the building by successive
layers, as e.g. [Aristot.] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rhet. ad Alex.</cite></span>
4 (p. 1426) ἐποικοδομοῦντα τὸ ἕτερον ὡς
ἐπὶ τὸ ἕτερον αὔξειν. Hence ἐποικοδομεῖν
is frequently used absolutely,
‘<em>to build up</em>’ (e.g. Jude 20, Polyb.
iii. 27, 4), as here. The repetition of
ἐν αὐτῷ emphasizes the main idea of
the passage, and indeed of the whole
epistle.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῇ πίστει] ‘<em>by your faith</em>’, the
dative of the instrument; comp. Heb.
xiii. 9 καλὸν γὰρ χάριτι βεβαιοῦσθαι
τὴν καρδίαν. Faith is, as it were, the
cement of the building: comp. Clem.
Rom. 22 ταῦτα πάντα βεβαιοῖ ἡ ἐν
Χριστῷ πίστις.</p>

<p class='c034'>καθὼς ἐδιδάχθητε] i.e. ‘remaining
true to the lessons which you received
from Epaphras, and not led
astray by any later pretenders’: comp.
i. 6, 7 ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, καθὼς ἐμάθετε ἀπὸ
Ἐπαφρᾶ.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν αὐτῇ κ.τ.λ.] The same ending
occurs in iv. 2. Thanksgiving is the
end of all human conduct, whether
exhibited in words or in works. For
the stress laid on thanksgiving in St
Paul’s epistles generally, see the note
on Phil. iv. 6. The words εὐχάριστος,
εὐχαριστεῖν, εὐχαριστία, occur in St
Paul’s writings alone of the Apostolic
epistles. In this epistle especially the
duty of thanksgiving assumes a peculiar
prominence by being made a
refrain, as here and in iii. 15, 17, iv.
2: see also i. 12.</p>

<p class='c033'>8–15. ‘Be on your guard; do not
suffer yourselves to fall a prey to
certain persons who would lead you
captive by a hollow and deceitful
system, which they call philosophy.
They substitute the traditions of men
for the truth of God. They enforce
an elementary discipline of mundane
ordinances fit only for children. Theirs
is not the Gospel of Christ. In Christ
the entire fulness of the Godhead
abides for ever, having united itself
with man by taking a human body.
And so in Him—not in any inferior
mediators—ye have your life, your
being, for ye are filled from His
fulness. He, I say, is the Head over
all spiritual beings—call them principalities
or powers or what you will.
In Him too ye have the true circumcision—the
circumcision which is not
made with hands but wrought by
the Spirit—the circumcision which
divests not of a part only but of the
whole carnal body—the circumcision
which is not of Moses but of Christ.
This circumcision ye have, because ye
were buried with Christ to your old
selves beneath the baptismal waters,
and were raised with Him from those
same waters to a new and regenerate
life, through your faith in the powerful
working of God who raised Him
from the dead. Yes, you—you Gentiles
who before were dead, when ye
walked in your transgressions and in
the uncircumcision of your unchastened
carnal heathen heart—even you did</p>

<p class='c034'>God quicken into life together with
Christ; then and there freely forgiving
all of us—Jews and Gentiles
alike—all our transgressions; then and
there cancelling the bond which stood
valid against us (for it bore our own
signature), the bond which engaged us
to fulfil all the law of ordinances, which
was our stern pitiless tyrant. Ay,
this very bond hath Christ put out
of sight for ever, nailing it to His
cross and rending it with His body
and killing it in His death. Taking
upon Him our human nature, He
stripped off and cast aside all the
powers of evil which clung to it like a
poisonous garment. As a mighty conqueror
He displayed these His fallen
enemies to an astonished world, leading
them in triumph on His cross.’</p>

<p class='c034'>8. Βλέπετε κ.τ.λ.] The form of the
sentence is a measure of the imminence
of the peril. The usual construction
with βλέπειν μὴ is a conjunctive; e.g.
in Luke xxi. 8 βλέπετε μὴ πλανηθῆτε.
Here the substitution of an indicative
shows that the danger is real; comp.
Heb. iii. 12 βλέπετε μήποτε ἔσται ἕν
τινι ὑμῶν καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας. For
other instances of μὴ with a future
indicative comp. Mark xiv. 2 μήποτε
ἔσται θόρυβος, Rom. xi. 21 μήπως οὐδὲ
σοῦ φείσεται; and see Winer § lvi. p.
631 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>τις] This indefinite τις is frequently
used by St Paul, when speaking of
opponents whom he knows well
enough but does not care to name:
see the note on Gal. i. 7. Comp. Ign.
<cite>Smyrn.</cite> 5 ὅν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τινες</em>&nbsp; ἀγνοοῦντες ἀρνοῦνται

<p class='c034'>συλαγωγῶν] ‘<em>makes you his prey</em>,
carries you off body and soul’. The
word appears not to occur before St
Paul, nor after him, independently of
this passage, till a late date: e.g. Heliod.
<cite>Aeth.</cite> x. 35 οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τὴν ἐμὴν θυγάτερα
συλαγωγήσας. In Tatian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad
Græc.</cite></span> 22 ὑμεῖς δὲ ὑπὸ τούτων συλαγωγεῖσθε
it seems to be a reminiscence
of St Paul. Its full and proper meaning,
as appears from the passages
quoted, is not ‘to despoil,’ but ‘to
carry off as spoil’, in accordance with
the analogous compounds, δουλαγωγεῖν,
σκευαγωγεῖν. So too the closely
allied word λαφυραγωγεῖν in Plut.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 5 πόλεμος γὰρ οὐ λαφυραγωγεῖ
ἀρετήν, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit. Galb.</cite></span> 5 τὰ μὲν Γαλατῶν,
ὅταν ὑποχείριοι γένωνται, λαφυραγωγήσεσθαι.
The Colossians had been rescued
from the bondage of darkness;
they had been transferred to the
kingdom of light; they had been
settled there as free citizens (i. 12,
13); and now there was danger that
they should fall into a state worse
than their former slavery, that they
should be carried off as so much
booty. Comp. 2 Tim. iii. 6 αἰχμαλωτίζοντες
γυναικάρια.</p>

<p class='c034'>For the construction ἔσται ὁ συλαγωγῶν
see the notes on Gal. i. 7, iii. 21.
The former passage is a close parallel
to the words here, εἰ μή τινές εἰσιν οἱ
ταράσσοντες ὑμᾶς κ.τ.λ. The expression
ὁ συλαγωγῶν gives a directness
and individuality to the reference,
which would have been wanting to the
more natural construction ὃς συλαγωγήσει.</p>

<p class='c034'>διὰ τῆς φιλοσοφίας κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>through
his philosophy which is an empty deceit</em>’.
The absence of both preposition
and article in the second clause shows
that κενῆς ἀπάτης describes and qualifies
φιλοσοφίας. Clement therefore
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> vi. 8, p. 771) had a right to
contend that St Paul does not here
condemn ‘philosophy’ absolutely. The
φιλοσοφία καὶ κενὴ ἀπάτη of this passage
corresponds to the ψευδώνυμος
γνῶσις of 1 Tim. vi. 20.</p>

<p class='c034'>But though ‘philosophy’ is not
condemned, it is disparaged by the
connexion in which it is placed. St
Chrysostom’s comment is not altogether
wrong, ἐπειδὴ δοκεῖ σεμνὸν εἶναι τὸ
τῆς φιλοσοφίας, προσέθηκε καὶ κενῆς
ἀπάτης. The term was doubtless used by
the false teachers themselves to describe
their system. Though essentially
Greek as a name and as an idea, it
had found its way into Jewish circles.
Philo speaks of the Hebrew religion
and Mosaic law as ἡ πάτριος φιλοσοφία
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. ad Cai.</cite></span> 23, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 568, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Somn.</cite></span> ii. 18, <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 675) or ἡ Ἰουδαϊκὴ
φιλοσοφία (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. ad Cai.</cite></span> 33, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 582)
or ἡ κατὰ Μω"υσῆν φιλοσοφία (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mut.
Nom.</cite></span> 39, <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 612). The system of
the Essenes, the probable progenitors
of the false teachers at Colossæ, he
describes as ἡ δίχα περιεργείας Ἑλληνικῶν
ὀνομάτων φιλοσοφία (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Omn. prob.
lib.</cite></span> 13, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 459). So too Josephus
speaks of the three Jewish sects as
τρεῖς φιλοσοφίαι (<cite>Ant.</cite> xviii. 1. 2, comp.
<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 2). It should be remembered
also, that in this later age,
owing to Roman influence, the term
was used to describe practical not less
than speculative systems, so that it
would cover the ascetic life as well as
the mystic theosophy of these Colossian
heretics. Hence the Apostle is
here flinging back at these false teachers
a favourite term of their own, ‘their
vaunted <em>philosophy</em>, which is hollow
and misleading’.</p>

<p class='c034'>The word indeed could claim a truly
noble origin; for it is said to have
arisen out of the humility of Pythagoras,
who called himself ‘a lover
of wisdom’, μηδένα γὰρ εἶναι σοφὸν
ἄνθρωπον ἀλλ’ ἢ Θεόν (Diog. Laert.
Pro&oelig;m. § 12; comp. Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Tusc.</cite></span> v. 3).
In such a sense the term would entirely
accord with the spirit and teaching
of St Paul; for it bore testimony
to the insufficiency of the human intellect
and the need of a revelation.
But in his age it had come to be associated
generally with the idea of subtle
dialectics and profitless speculation;
while in this particular instance it was
combined with a mystic cosmogony
and angelology which contributed a
fresh element of danger. As contrasted
with the power and fulness
and certainty of revelation, all such
philosophy was ‘foolishness’ (1 Cor.
i. 20). It is worth observing that this
word, which to the Greeks denoted
the highest effort of the intellect, occurs
here alone in St Paul, just as he
uses ἀρετή, which was their term to
express the highest moral excellence,
in a single passage only (Phil. iv. 8;
see the note there). The reason is
much the same in both cases. The
Gospel had deposed the terms as
inadequate to the higher standard,
whether of knowledge or of practice,
which it had introduced.</p>

<p class='c034'>On the attitude of the fathers towards
philosophy, while philosophy
was a living thing, see Smith’s <cite>Dictionary
of the Bible</cite> s.v. Clement,
who was followed in the main by the
earlier Alexandrian fathers, regards
Greek philosophy not only as a preliminary
training (προπαιδεία) for the
Gospel, but even as in some sense a
covenant (διαθήκη) given by God to the
Greeks (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> i. 5, p. 331, vi. 5, p. 761,
<em>ib.</em> § 8, p. 771 sq.). Others, who were
the great majority and of whom Tertullian
may be taken as an extreme
type, set their faces directly against
it, seeing in it only the parent of all
heretical teaching: e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Anim.</cite></span> 2, 3,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apol.</cite></span> 46, 47. In the first passage,
referring to this text, he says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Ab
apostolo jam tunc philosophia concussio
veritatis providebatur’</span>; in the
second he asks, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Quid simile philosophus
et Christianus?’</span> St Paul’s
speech at Athens, on the only occasion
when he is known to have
been brought into direct personal
contact with Greek philosophers (Acts
xvii. 18), shows that his sympathies
would have been at least as strong
with Clement’s representations as with
Tertullian’s.</p>

<p class='c033'>κατὰ κ.τ.λ.] The false teaching is

traditions of <em>men</em>’; (2) As regards
its subject matter–‘the rudiments of
<em>the world</em>’.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὴν παράδοσιν κ.τ.λ.] Other systems,
as for instance the ceremonial mishna
of the Pharisees, might fitly be described
in this way (Matt. xv. 2 sq.,
Mark vii. 3 sq.): but such a description
was peculiarly appropriate to a
mystic theosophy like this of the Colossian
false teachers. The teaching
might be oral or written, but it was
essentially esoteric, essentially traditional.
It could not appeal to sacred
books which had been before all the
world for centuries. The Essenes,
the immediate spiritual progenitors
of these Colossian heretics, distinctly
claimed to possess such a source of
knowledge, which they carefully
guarded from divulgence; <cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 7
συντηρήσειν ὁμοίως τά τε τῆς αἱρέσεως
αυτῶν βιβλία καὶ τὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων ὀνόματα
(see above pp. 89, 90 sq., 95).
The various Gnostic sects, their direct
or collateral spiritual descendants,
almost without exception traced their
doctrines to a similar source: e.g.
Hippol. <cite>Hær.</cite> v. 7 ἃ φησὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>παραδεδωκέναι</em>&nbsp;

later mystic theology of the Jews,

The same phrase occurs again Gal. iv.
3 (comp. ver. 9). As στοιχεῖα signifies
primarily ‘the letters of the alphabet’,
so as a secondary meaning it denotes
‘rudimentary instruction’. Accordingly
it is correctly interpreted by
Clement <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> vi. 8 (p. 771) Παῦλος ...

v. 19 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>secundum elementa mundi</em>, non
secundum cælum et terram dicens,
sed secundum literas seculares’</span>. A
large number of the fathers however
explained the expression to refer to
the heavenly bodies (called στοιχεῖα),
as marking the seasons, so that the
observance of ‘festivals and new-moons
and sabbaths’ was a sort of
bondage to them. It would appear
from Tertullian’s language that Marcion
also had so interpreted the
words. On this false interpretation
see the note on Gal. iv. 3. It is quite
out of place here: for (1) The context
suggests some <em>mode of instruction</em>,
e.g. τὴν παράδοσιν τῶν ἀνθρώπων here,
and δογματίζεσθε in ver. 20; (2) The
keeping of days and seasons is quite
subordinate to other external observances.
The rite of circumcision
(ver. 11), and the distinction of meats
(ver. 21) respectively, are placed in
close and immediate connexion with
τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου in the two
places where it occurs, whereas the
observance of days and seasons (ver. 16)
stands apart from either.</p>

<p class='c034'>τοῦ κόσμου] ‘<em>of the world</em>’, that is,
‘belonging to the sphere of material
and external things’. See the notes
on Gal. iv. 3, vi. 14.</p>

<p class='c034'>‘In Christ’, so the Apostle seems
to say, ‘you have attained the liberty
and the intelligence of manhood; do
not submit yourselves again to a rudimentary
discipline fit only for children
(τὰ στοιχεῖα). In Christ you
have been exalted into the sphere of

<p class='c033'>οὐ κατὰ Χριστόν] ‘<em>not after Christ</em>’.
This expression is wide in itself, and
should be interpreted so as to supply
the negative to both the preceding
clauses; ‘Christ is neither the author
nor the substance of their teaching:
not the author, for they listen to human
traditions (κατὰ τὴν παράδοσιν
τῶν ἀνθρώπων); not the substance, for
they replace Him by formal ordinances
(κατὰ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου) and by
angelic mediators‘.</p>

<p class='c034'>9 sq. In explaining the true doctrine
which is ‘after Christ’, St Paul
condemns the two false principles,
which lay at the root of this heretical
teaching; (1) The <em>theological</em> error of
substituting inferior and created beings
angelic mediators for the divine
Head Himself (vv. 9, 10); and (2) The
<em>practical</em> error of insisting upon ritual
and ascetic observances, as the foundation
of their moral teaching (vv. 11–14).
Their theological speculations
and their ethical code alike were at
fault. On the intimate connexion between
these two errors, as springing
out of a common root, the Gnostic
dualism of these false teachers, see
the introduction, pp. 33 sq., 79, 87,
180 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὅτι κ.τ.λ.] The Apostle justifies the
foregoing charge that this doctrine
was not κατὰ Χριστόν; ‘In Christ
dwells the whole pleroma, the entire
fulness of the Godhead, whereas they
represent it to you as dispersed among
several spiritual agencies. Christ is
the one fountain-head of all spiritual
life, whereas they teach you to seek it
in communion with inferior creatures.’
The same truths have been stated before
(i. 14 sq.) more generally and they
are now restated with direct and immediate
reference to the heretical
teaching.</p>

<p class='c034'>κατοικεῖ] ‘<em>has its fixed abode</em>’. On
the force of this compound in relation
to the false teaching, see the note on
i. 19.</p>

<p class='c034'>πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα] ‘<em>all the plenitude</em>’,
‘the totality of the divine powers and
attributes’. On this theological term
see i. 19, and the detached note at the
end of the epistle.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῆς θεότητος] ‘<em>of the Godhead</em>’.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Non modo divinæ virtutes, sed ipsa

the difference between θέοτης <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>deitas</em>’</span>,
the essence, and θειότης <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>divinitas</em>’</span>,
the quality, see Trench <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>N. T. Syn.</cite></span>

the two words may be seen by a
comparison of two passages in Plutarch,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 857 <span class='fss'>A</span> πᾶσιν Αἰγυπτίοις
θειότητα πολλὴν καὶ δικαιοσύνην μαρτυρήσας

inspiration or faculty, and where no
one would have used θεότητα), and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> 415 <span class='fss'>C</span> ἐκ δὲ ἡρώων εἰς δαίμονας αἱ

θειότητος would be quite out of place,
because all δαίμονες without exception
were θεῖοι, though they only became
θεοί in rare instances and after long
probation and discipline). In the
New Testament the one word occurs
here alone, the other in Rom. i. 20
alone. So also τὸ θεῖον, a very favourite
expression in Greek philosophy, is
found once only, in Acts xvii. 29, where
it is used with singular propriety; for
the Apostle is there meeting the heathen
philosophers on their own ground
and arguing with them in their own
language. Elsewhere he instinctively
avoids a term which tends to obscure
the idea of a personal God. In the
Latin versions, owing to the poverty of
the language, both θέοτης and θείοτης
are translated by the same term <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>divinitas</em></span>;
but this was felt to be inadequate,
and the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>deitas</em></span> was coined
at a later date to represent θέοτης:
August. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Civ. Dei</cite></span> vii. § 1, <span class='fss'>VII.</span> p. 162
(quoted in Trench) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Hanc divinitatem
vel, ut sic dixerim, <em>deitatem</em>: nam et
hoc verbo uti jam nostros non piget,
ut de Græco expressius transferant id
quod illi θεότητα appellant etc.’</span></p>

<p class='c034'>σωματικῶς] ‘<em>bodily-wise</em>’, ‘<em>corporeally</em>’,
i.e. ‘assuming a bodily form,
becoming incarnate’. This is an addition
to the previous statement in
i. 19 ἐν αυτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα
κατοικῆσαι. The indwelling of the pleroma
refers to the Eternal Word, and
not to the Incarnate Christ; but σωματικῶς
is added to show that the
Word, in whom the pleroma thus had
its abode from all eternity, crowned
His work by the Incarnation. Thus
while the main statement κατοικεῖ πᾶν
τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος of St Paul
corresponds to the opening sentence
ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν Θὲον καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ
λόγος of St John, the subsidiary adverb
σωματικῶς of St Paul has its
counterpart in the additional statement
καὶ ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο of St
John. All other meanings which have
been assigned to σωματικῶς here, as
‘wholly’ (Hieron. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Is.</cite></span> xi. 1 sq., <span class='fss'>IV.</span>

cxlix, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 513 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Ideo corporaliter dixit,

‘essentially’ (Hilar. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> viii. 54,

Isid. Pelus. <cite>Ep.</cite> iv. 166 ἀντὶ τοῦ οὐσιωδῶς),
are unsupported by usage. Nor
again can the body be understood of
anything else but Christ’s human body;
as for instance of the created World
(Theod. Mops. in Rab. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VI.</span> p. 522)
or of the Church (Anon. in Chrysost. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad
loc.</cite></span>). According to these two last interpretations
τὸ πλήρομα τῆς θεότητος is
taken to mean the Universe (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘universam
naturam repletam ab eo’</span>) and the
Church (τὴν ἐκκλησίαν πεπληρωμένην
ὑπὸ τῆς θεότητος αὐτοῦ, see Ephes. i. 23)
respectively, because either of these
may be said to reside in Him, as the
source of its life, and to stand to Him
in the relation of the body to the
head (σωματικῶς). But these forced
interpretations have nothing to recommend
them.</p>

<p class='c034'>St Paul’s language is carefully
guarded. He does not say ἐν σώματι,
for the Godhead cannot be confined
to any limits of space; nor σωματοειδῶς,
for this might suggest the unreality
of Christ’s human body; but
σωματικῶς, ‘in bodily wise’, ‘with a
bodily manifestation’. The relation
of σωματικῶς to the clause which it
qualifies will depend on the circumstances
of the case: comp. e.g. Plut.

<p class='c033'>πεπληρωμένοι] ‘<em>being fulfilled</em>’, with
a direct reference to the preceding
πλήρωμα; ‘Your fulness comes from
His fulness; His πλήρωμα is transfused
into you by virtue of your incorporation
in Him’. So too John
i. 16 ἐκ τοῦ πληρώματος αὐτοῦ ἡμεῖς
πάντες ἐλάβομεν, Ephes. iii. 19 ἵνα πληρωθῆτε
εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ Θεοῦ,

τοῦ Χριστοῦ, comp. Ign. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ephes.</cite></span>
init. τῇ εὐλογημένῃ ἐν μεγέθει Θεοῦ
πατρὸς πληρώματι. Hence also the
Church, as ideally regarded, is called
the πλήρωμα of Christ, because all His
graces and energies are communicated
to her; Ephes. i. 23 ἥτις ἐστὶν τὸ σῶμα
αὐτοῦ, τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ τὰ πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν
πληρουμένου.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὅς] For the various reading ὅ see
the detached note. It was perhaps a
correction made on the false supposition
that ἐν αὐτῷ referred to the
πλήρωμα. At all events it must be regarded
as an impossible reading; for
the image would be altogether confused
and lost, if the πλήρωμα were
represented as the head. And again
ἡ κεφαλὴ is persistently said elsewhere
of Christ; i. 18, ii. 19, Ephes. i. 22,
iv. 15, v. 23. Hilary <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> ix. 8
(<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 264) explains the ὅ as referring
to the whole sentence τὸ εἶναι ἐν αὐτῷ
πεπληρωμένους, but this also is an inconceivable
sense. Again it has been
suggested that ὅ ἐστιν (like τουτέστιν)
may be taken as equivalent to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>scilicet</em></span>
(comp. Clem. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hom.</cite></span> viii. 22); but this
would require τῇ κεφαλῇ, even if it
were otherwise admissible here.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἡ κεφαλὴ] The image expresses much
more than the idea of sovereignty: the
head is also the centre of vital force,
the source of all energy and life: see
the note on ver. 19.</p>

<p class='c034'>πάσης ἀρχῆς κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>of every principality
and power</em>’, and therefore
of those angelic beings whom the
false teachers adopted as mediators,
thus transferring to the inferior members
the allegiance due to the Head:
comp. ver. 18 sq. For ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας,
see the note on i. 16.</p>

<p class='c034'>11. The previous verses have dealt
with the theological tenets of the false
teachers. The Apostle now turns to
their practical errors; ‘You do not
need the circumcision of the flesh;
for you have received the circumcision
of the heart. The distinguishing features
of this higher circumcision are
threefold. (1) It is not external but
inward, not made with hands but
wrought by the Spirit. (2) It divests
not of a part only of the flesh, but of
the whole body of carnal affections.
(3) It is the circumcision not of
Moses or of the patriarchs, but of
Christ’. Thus it is distinguished, as
regards <em>first</em> its character, <em>secondly</em>
its extent, and <em>thirdly</em> its author.</p>

<p class='c034'>περιετμήθητε] The moment at which
this is conceived as taking place is
defined by the other aorists, συνταφέντες,
συνηγέρθητε, etc., as the time
of their baptism, when they ‘put on
Christ’.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀχειροποιήτῳ] i.e. ‘immaterial’, ‘spiritual’,
as Mark xiv. 58, 2 Cor. v. 1.
So χειροποίητος, which is used in the
N. T. of material temples and their
furniture (Acts vii. 48, xvii. 24, Heb.
ix. 11, 24, comp. Mark <em>l.c.</em>), and of the
material circumcision (Ephes. ii. 11
τῆς λεγομένης περιτομῆς ἐν σαρκὶ χειροποιήτου).
In the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> χειροποίητα
occurs exclusively as a rendering of
idols (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אלילם</span>, e.g. Lev. xxvi. 1, Is. ii.
18, etc.), false gods (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אלהים</span> Is. xxi. 9,
where perhaps they read <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">אלילים</span>), or
images (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">חמנים</span> Lev. xxvi. 30), except in
one passage, Is. xvi. 12, where it is
applied to an idol’s sanctuary. Owing
to this association of the word the
application which we find in the New
Testament would sound much more
depreciatory to Jewish ears than it
does to our own; e.g. ἐν χειροποιήτοις
κατοικεῖ in St Stephen’s speech, where
the force of the passage is broken in
the received text by the interpolation
of ναοῖς.</p>

<p class='c034'>For illustrations of the typical significance
of circumcision, as a symbol
of purity, see the note on Phil. iii. 3.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν τῇ κ.τ.λ.] The words are chosen to
express the <em>completeness</em> of the spiritual
change. (1) It is not an ἔκδυσις
nor an ἀπόδυσις, but an ἀπέκδυσις.
The word ἀπέκδυσις is extremely rare,
and no earlier instances of it are produced;
see the note on ver. 15 ἀπεκδυσάμενος.
(2) It is not a single member
but the whole body, which is thus
cast aside; see the next note. Thus
the idea of completeness is brought
out both in the energy of the action
and in the extent of its operation, as
in iii. 9 ἀπεκδυσάμενοι τὸν παλαιὸν

<p class='c033'>τοῦ σώματος κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>the whole body</em>
which consists <em>of the flesh</em>’, i.e. ‘the
body with all its corrupt and carnal
affections’; as iii. 5 νεκρώσατε οὖν
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τὰ μέλη</em>&nbsp;. For illustrations of the
expression see Rom. vi. 6 ἵνα καταργηθῇ
τὸ σῶμα τῆς ἁμαρτίας, vii. 24 τοῦ
σώματος τοῦ θανάτου τούτου, Phil. iii.
21 τὸ σῶμα τῆς ταπεινώσεως ἡμῶν.
Thus τὸ σῶμα τῆς σαρκός here means
‘the fleshly body’ and not ‘the entire
mass of the flesh’; but the contrast
between the whole and the part still
remains. In i. 22 the same expression
τὸ σῶμα τῆς σαρκός occurs, but with a
different emphasis and meaning: see
the note there.</p>

<p class='c034'>The words τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν, inserted between
τοῦ σώματος and τῆς σαρκός in
the received text, are clearly a gloss,
and must be omitted with the vast
majority of ancient authorities.</p>

<p class='c034'>12. Baptism is the grave of the
old man, and the birth of the new.
As he sinks beneath the baptismal
waters, the believer buries there all
his corrupt affections and past sins;
as he emerges thence, he rises regenerate,
quickened to new hopes
and a new life. This it is, because
it is not only the crowning act of his
own faith but also the seal of God’s
adoption and the earnest of God’s
Spirit. Thus baptism is an image of
his participation both in the death and
in the resurrection of Christ. See
<cite>Apost. Const.</cite> iii. 17 ἡ κατάδυσις τὸ
συναποθανεῖν, ἡ ἀνάδυσις τὸ συναναστῆναι.
For this twofold image, as it
presents itself to St Paul, see especially
Rom. vi. 3 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν τῷ βαπτισμῷ] ‘<em>in the act of
baptism</em>’. A distinction seems to be
observed elsewhere in the New Testament
between βάπτισμα ‘baptism’
properly so called, and βαπτισμός
‘lustration’ or ‘washing’ of divers
kinds, e.g. of vessels (Mark vii. 4, [8,]
Heb. ix. 10). Even Heb. vi. 2 βαπτισμῶν
διδαχῆς, which at first sight
might seem to be an exception to this
rule, is perhaps not really so (Bleek
<em>ad loc.</em>). Here however, where the
various readings βαπτισμῷ and βαπτίσματι
appear in competition, the
preference ought probably to be
given to βαπτισμῷ as being highly
supported in itself (see the detached
note on various readings) and as the
less usual word in this sense. There
is no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>a priori</em></span> reason why St Paul
should not have used βαπτισμός with
this meaning, for it is so found in Josephus
<cite>Ant.</cite> xviii. 5. 2 βαπτισμῷ συνιέναι
(of John the Baptist). Doubtless
the form βάπτισμα was more appropriate
to describe the one final and
complete act of Christian baptism,
and it very soon obtained exclusive
possession of the ground in Greek;
but in St Paul’s age the other form
βαπτισμός may not yet have been
banished. In the Latin Version <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>baptisma</em></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>baptismus</em></span> are used indiscriminately:
and this is the case also
with the Latin fathers. The substantive
‘baptism’ occurs so rarely in any
sense in St Paul (only Rom. vi. 4, Eph.
iv. 5, besides this passage), or indeed
elsewhere in the N. T. of Christian
baptism (only in 1 Pet. iii. 21), that
we have not sufficient data for a
sound induction. So far as the two
words have any inherent difference of
meaning, βαπτισμός denotes rather the
act in process and βάπτισμα the result.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἐν ᾧ] i.e. βαπτισμῷ. Others would
understand Χριστῷ for the sake of
the parallelism with ver. 11 ἐν hῷ
καὶ ... εν ᾧ καί. But this parallelism is
not suggested by the sense: while on
the other hand there is obviously a
very close connexion between συνταφέντες
and συνηγέρθητε as the two
complementary aspects of baptism;
comp. Rom. vi. 4 sq. &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>συνετάφημεν</em>&nbsp;
αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ βαπτίσματος ἵνα ὥσπερ
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐγέρθη</em>&nbsp; Χριστὸς ... ὅυτως καὶ ἡμεῖς ... εἰ
γὰρ σύμφυτοι γεγόναμεν τῷ ὁμοίωματι
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τοῦ θανάτου</em>&nbsp; αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τῆς
ἀναστάσεως</em>&nbsp; ἐσόμεθα, 2 Tim. ii. 11
εἰ γὰρ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>συναπεθάνομεν</em>&nbsp;, καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>συνζήσομεν</em>&nbsp;.
In fact the idea of Χριστῷ
must be reserved for συνηγέρθητε
where it is wanted, ‘<em>ye were raised
together with Him</em>’.</p>

<p class='c034'>διὰ τῆς πίστεως κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>through
your faith in the operation</em>,’ ἐνεργείας
being the objective genitive. So St
Chrysostom, πίστεως ὅλον ἐστίν· ἐπιστεύσατε
ὅτι δύναται ὁ Θεὸς ἐγεῖραι,
καὶ οὕτως ἠγέρθητε. Only by a belief
in the resurrection are the benefits of
the resurrection obtained, because
only so are its moral effects produced.
Hence St Paul prays that he may
‘know the <em>power</em> of Christ’s resurrection’
(Phil. iii. 10). Hence too he
makes this the cardinal article in the
Christian’s creed, ‘If thou ... believest
in thy heart that God raised Him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved’
(Rom. x. 9). For the influence of
Christ’s resurrection on the moral and
spiritual being, see the note on Phil.
<em>l.c.</em> Others take τῆς ἐνεργείας as the
subjective genitive, ‘faith which comes
from the operation etc.’, arguing from
a mistaken interpretation of the parallel
passage Ephes. i. 19 (where κατὰ
τῆν ἐνέργειαν should be connected, not
with τοὺς πιστεύοντας, but with τί τὸ
ὑπερβάλλον μέγεθος κ.τ.λ.). The former
explanation however yields a better
sense, and the genitive after πίστις
far more commonly describes the object
than the source of the faith, e.g.
Rom. iii. 22, 26, Gal. iii. 22, Ephes. iii.
12, Phil. i. 27, iii. 9, 2 Thess. ii. 13.</p>

<p class='c034'>13. In the sentence which follows
it seems necessary to assume a change
of subject. There can be little doubt
that ὁ Θεὸς is the nominative to συνεζωοποίησεν:
for (1) The parallel passage
Ephes. ii. 4, 5 directly suggests
this. (2) This is uniformly St Paul’s
mode of speaking elsewhere. It is
always God who ἐγέιρει, συνεγέιρει,
ζωοποιεῖ, συνζωοποιεῖ, etc., with or in
or through Christ. (3) Though it might
be possible to assign σὺν αὐτῷ to the
subject of συνεζωοποίησεν (see the note
on i. 20), yet a reference to some other
person is more natural. These reasons
seem to decide the subject of συνεζωοποίησεν.
But at the same time it
appears quite impossible to continue
the same subject, ὁ Θεός, to the end of
the sentence. No grammatical meaning
can be assigned to ἀπεκδυσάμενος,
by which it could be understood of
God the Father. We must suppose
therefore that a new subject, ὁ Χριστός,
is introduced meanwhile, either
with ἦρκεν or with ἀπεκδυσάμενος itself;
and of the two the former seems
the easier point of transition. For a
similar instance of abrupt transition,
which is the more natural owing to the
intimate connexion of the work of the
Son with the work of the Father, see
e.g. i. 17 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ ὑμᾶς] i.e. ‘you Gentiles’. This
will appear from a study of the
parallel passages iii. 7, 8, Ephes. i. 13,
ii. 1 sq., 11, 13, 17, 22, iii. 2, iv. 17;

<p class='c033'>τοῖς παραπτώμασιν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>by reason
of your transgressions etc.</em>’ The παραπτώματα
are the actual definite transgressions,
while the ἀκροβυστία τῆς
σαρκός is the impure carnal disposition
which prompts to them. For the dative
comp. Ephes. ii. 1, 5, where the
same expression occurs; see Winer
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Gramm.</cite></span> § xxxi. p. 270. On the other
hand in Rom. vi. 11 νεκροὺς μὲν τῇ
ἁμαρτίᾳ, ζῶντας δὲ τῷ Θεῷ, the dative
has a wholly different meaning, as the
context shows. The ἐν of the received
text, though highly supported, is doubtless
an interpolation for the sake of
grammatical clearness.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ κ.τ.λ.] The external
fact is here mentioned, not for its own
sake but for its symbolical meaning.
The outward uncircumcision of the
Gentiles is a type of their unchastened
carnal mind. In other words, though
the literal meaning is not excluded,
the spiritual reference is most prominent,
as appears from ver. 11 ἐν τῆι
ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος. Hence Theodore’s
comment, ἀκροβυστίαν (ἐκάλεσεν)
τὸ περικεῖσθαι ἔτι τὴν θνητότητα.
At the same time the choice of the
expression shows that the Colossian
converts addressed by St Paul were
mainly Gentiles.</p>

<p class='c034'>συνεζωοποίησεν] It has been questioned
whether the life here spoken of
should be understood in a spiritual
sense of the regeneration of the moral
being, or in a literal sense of the future
life of immortality regarded as
conferred on the Christian potentially
now, though only to be realised hereafter.
But is not such an issue altogether
superfluous? Is there any reason
to think that St Paul would have
separated these two ideas of life? To
him the future glorified life is only
the continuation of the present moral
and spiritual life. The two are the
same in essence, however the accidents
may differ. Moral and spiritual regeneration
is salvation, is life.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὑμᾶς] The pronoun is repeated for
the sake of emphasis. The omission
in some good copies is doubly explained;
(1) By the desire to simplify
the grammar; (2) By the wish to relieve
the awkwardness of the close
proximity between ὑμᾶς and ἡμῖν. This
latter consideration has led a few
good authorities to substitute ἡμᾶς for
ὑμᾶς, and others to substitute ὑμῖν for
ἡμῖν. For instances of those emphatic
repetitions in St Paul see the note on
i. 20 δι’ αὐτοῦ.</p>

<p class='c034'>σὺν αὐτῳ] ‘with Christ’, as in Ephes.
ii. 5 συνεζωοποίησεν τῷ Χριστῷ. On
the inadmissibility of the reading ἁυτῷ
see the note on εἰς αὐτὸν i. 20.</p>

<p class='c034'>χαρισάμενος] ‘<em>having forgiven</em>’, as
in Luke vii. 42 sq., 2 Cor. ii. 7, 10,
xii. 13, Ephes. iv. 32; see also the note
on iii. 13 below. The idea of sin as a
debt incurred to God (Matt. vi. 12 τὰ
ὀφειλήματα ἡμῶν, comp. Luke xi. 4)
underlies this expression, as it does
also the commoner term for pardon,
ἄφεσις ‘remission’. The image is
carried out in the cancelled bond,
ver. 14.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἡμῖν] The person is changed; ‘not
to you Gentiles only, but to us all
alike’. St Paul is eager to claim his
share in the transgression, that he
may claim it also in the forgiveness.
For other examples of the change
from the second to the first person,
see i. 10–13, iii. 3, 4, Ephes. ii. 2, 3,
13, 14, iv. 31, 32, v. 2 (the correct
reading), 1 Thess. v. 5, where the motive
of the change is similar. See also
Gal. iii. 25, 26, iv. 5, 6, where there is
the converse transition.</p>

<p class='c033'>14. ἐξαλέιψας] ‘<em>having cancelled</em>’.
The word ἐξαλέιφειν, like διαγράφειν,
signifying ‘to blot out, to erase’, is
commonly opposed to ἐγγράφειν ‘to
enter a name, etc.’; e.g. Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pax</cite></span>

... ἐξαλήλιπται τὸ ὄφλημα.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸ καθ’ ἡμῶν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>the bond standing
against us</em>’. The word χειρόγραφον,
which means properly an autograph
of any kind, is used almost exclusively
for a note of hand, a bond or
obligation, as having the ‘sign-manual’
of the debtor or contractor: e.g. Tobit
v. 3 (comp. ix. 5) ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὸ χειρόγραφον,
Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 829 <span class='fss'>A</span> τῶν χειρογράφων
καὶ συμβολαίων. It is more
common in Latin than in Greek, e.g.
Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fam.</cite></span> vii. 18 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Misi cautionem chirographi

aut sumptos pergit non reddere
nummos, vana supervacui dicens
chirographa ligni’</span> (comp. xiii. 137).
Hence chirographum, chirographarius,
are frequent terms in the Roman law-books;
see Hesse <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Handlexicon zu
den Quellen des römischen Rechts</cite></span>
s.v. p. 74.</p>

<p class='c034'>In the case before us the Jewish
people might be said to have signed
the contract when they bound themselves
by a curse to observe all the
enactments of the law (Deut. xxvii.
14–26; comp. Exod. xxiv. 3); and
the primary reference would be to
them. But ἡμῖν, ἡμῶν, seem to include
Gentiles as well as Jews, so that
a wider reference must be given to
the expression. The δόγματα therefore,
though referring primarily to the
Mosaic ordinances, will include all
forms of positive decrees in which
moral or social principles are embodied
or religious duties defined; and
the ‘bond’ is the moral assent of the
conscience, which (as it were) signs
and seals the obligation. The Gentiles,
though ‘not having a law, are a
law to themselves’, ὅιτινες ἐνδείκνυνται

<p class='c034'>τοῖς δόγμασιν] ‘<em>consisting in ordinances</em>’:
comp. Ephes. ii. 15 τὸν νόμον
τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασιν. The word
δόγμα is here used in its proper sense
of a ‘decree’, ‘ordinance’, corresponding
to δογματίζεσθε below, ver. 20.
This is its only sense in the N. T.;
e.g. Luke ii. 1, Acts xvii. 7, of the
Emperor’s decrees; Acts xvi. 4 of the
Apostolic ordinances. Here it refers
especially to the Mosaic law, as in
Joseph. <cite>Ant.</cite> xv. 5. 3 τὰ κάλλιστα τῶν
δογμάτων καὶ τὰ ὁσιώτατα τῶν ἐν τοῖς
νόμοις, Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. All.</cite></span> i. 16 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 54)
διατήρησις τῶν ἁγίων δογμάτων, 3 Macc.
i. 3 τῶν πατρίων δογμάτων. Comp.
Iren. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fragm.</cite></span> 38 (p. 855 Stieren) where,
immediately after a reference to our
text, τοῖς τῶν Ἰουδαίων δόγμασι προσέρχεσθαι
is opposed to πνευματικῶς
λειτουργεῖν. In the parallel passage,
Ephes. ii. 15, this is the exclusive
reference; but here (for reasons explained
in the last note) it seems best
to give the term a secondary and
more extensive application.</p>

<p class='c034'>The dative is perhaps best explained
as governed by the idea of γεγραμμένον
involved in χειρόγραφον (comp.
Plat. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ep.</cite></span> vii. p. 243 <span class='fss'>A</span> τὰ γεγραμμένα
τύποις); as in 1 Tim. ii. 6 τὸ μαρτύριον
καιροῖς ἰδίοις, where καιροῖς depends
on an implied μεμαρτυρημένον. Otherwise
it is taken as closely connected
with καθ’ ἡμῶν, ‘the bond which was
in force against us by reason of the
ordinances’: see Winer § xxxi. p.
273, A. Buttmann p. 80. Possibly an
ἐν has dropped out of the text before
τοῖς δόγμασιν, owing to the similar
ending <span class="uncial">χειρογραφονεν</span> (comp. Ephes.
ii. 15); but, if so, the omission must
date from the earliest age, since no
existing authorities exhibit any traces
of such a reading; see the note on
ver. 18 ἃ ἑόρακεν, and comp. Phil. ii.
1 εἴ τις σπλάγχνα.</p>

<p class='c034'>A wholly different interpretation
however prevails universally among
Greek commentators both here and
in Ephes. ii. 15. They take τοῖς δόγμασιν,
ἐν δόγμασιν, to mean the ‘doctrines
or precepts of the Gospel’, and
so to describe the instrument by
which the abrogation of the law was
effected. So Chrysostom, Severianus,
Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Theodoret,
followed by the later commentators
&OElig;cumenius and Theophylact.
Strangely enough they do not allude
to the correct interpretation; nor (with
the exception of the passage ascribed
to Irenæus which is quoted above)
have I found any distinct traces of it
in any Greek father. The grammatical
difficulty would be taken to favour
this interpretation, which moreover
was characteristic of the age when
the battle of creeds was fought. But
it has been universally abandoned by
modern interpreters, as plainly inappropriate
to the context and also as
severing the substantive δόγμα here
from the verb δογματίζειν in ver. 20. The
Latin fathers, who had either <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>decretis</em></span>
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sententiis</em></span> in their version, were
saved from this false interpretation;
e.g. Hilar. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> i. 12 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 10),
ix. 10 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 265 sq.), Ambros. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apol.

p. 499), August. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Pecc. Mer.</cite></span> i. 47
(<span class='fss'>X.</span> p. 26): though they very commonly
took τοῖς δόγμασιν, ἐν δόγμασιν, to
refer to the decree of condemnation.
Jerome however on Ephes. ii. 15
(<span class='fss'>VII.</span> p. 581) follows the Greeks. The
later Christian sense of δόγμα, meaning
‘doctrine’, came from its secondary
classical use, where it was applied to
the authoritative and categorical ‘sentences’
of the philosophers: comp.
Just. Mart. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apol.</cite></span> i. 7 (p. 56 <span class='fss'>D</span>) οἱ ἐν

<p class='c033'>ὃ ἦν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>which was directly opposed

τὸ καθ’ ἡμῶν, referred to the <em>validity</em>
of the bond; the present, ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον
ἡμῖν, describes its <em>active hostility</em>.
It is quite a mistake to suppose that
the first preposition in ὑπεναντίος
mitigates its force, as in ὑποδήλωσις,
ὑπόλευκος, ὑπομαίνομαι, ὑποσημαίνειν,
etc. Neither in classical writers nor
in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> has the word any shade of
this meaning. It is very commonly
used for instance, of things which are
directly antagonistic and mutually
exclusive: e.g. Aristot. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Gen.

Καὶ μὴν δύο γε ὑπεναντία ἑνὶ πράγματι
πῶς ἂν εἴη; (i.e. how can one thing
have two direct opposites?), where
the whole argument depends on this
sense of ὑπεναντίος. In compounds
with ὑπὸ the force of the preposition
will generally be determined by the
meaning of the other element in the
compound; and, as ἐναντίος (ἔναντι)
implies locality, a local sense is communicated
to ὑπό. Thus ὑπεναντίος may
be compared with ὑπαλλάσσειν, ὑπαντᾶν,
ὑπαντιάζειν, ὑποτρέχειν (Xen.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Cyrop.</cite></span> i. 2. 12 ληστὰς ὑποδραμεῖν, ‘to
hunt down’), ὑπελάυνειν (Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Anab.</cite></span>
i. 8. 15 ὑπελάσας ὡς συναντῆσαι, ‘riding
up’), ὑφιστάναι (Polyb. i. 50. 6 ὑπέστησε
τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ναῦν ἀντίπρωρον τοῖς
πολεμίοις, ‘he brought up’ his own ship).
With this meaning, ‘over against,’
‘close in upon,’ the preposition does
not weaken but enhance the force of
ἐναντίος, so that the compound will
denote ‘direct,’ ‘close,’ or ‘persistent
opposition.’</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>and He</em>, i.e.
Christ, <em>hath taken it away</em>’. There
is a double change in this clause: (1)
The participles (χαρισάμενος, ἐξαλέιψας)
are replaced by a finite verb.
(2) The aorists (συνεζωοποίησεν, χαρισάμενος,
ἐξαλέιψας) are replaced by
a perfect. The substitution of ᾖρεν
for ἦρκεν in some copies betrays a
consciousness on the part of the scribes
of the dislocation produced by the
new tense. As a new subject, ὁ
Χριστός, must be introduced somewhere
(see the note on ver. 13), the
severance thus created suggests this
as the best point of transition. The
perfect ἦρκεν, ‘He hath removed it’,
is suggested by the feeling of relief
and thanksgiving, which rises up in
the Apostle’s mind at this point. For
the strong expression ἄιρειν ἐκ [τοῦ]

sight’, comp. <span class='fss'>LXX</span> Is. lvii. 2, Epictet.

<p class='c033'>προσηλώσας κ.τ.λ.] ‘The abrogation
was even more emphatic. Not only

the law of ordinances was nailed to

nail through it and hanging it up in

of such a custom.</p>

<p class='c034'>15. ἀπεκδυσάμενος κ.τ.λ.] This
word appears not to occur at all before
St Paul, and rarely if ever after
his time, except in writers who may
be supposed to have his language before
them; e.g. Hippol. <cite>Hær.</cite> i. 24
ἀπεκδυσάμενον τὸ σῶμα ὃ περικεῖται.
In Joseph. <cite>Ant.</cite> vi. 14. 2 ἀπεκδὺς is
only a variation for μετεκδὺς which
seems to be the correct reading. The
word also appears in some texts of
Babrius <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fab.</cite></span> xviii. 3, but it is merely
a conjectural emendation. Thus the
occurrence of ἀπεκδύεσθαι here and in
iii. 9, and of ἀπέκδυσις above in ver. 11,
is remarkable; and the choice of an
unusual, if not a wholly new, word
must have been prompted by the desire
to emphasize the <em>completeness</em> of
the action. The force of the double
compound may be inferred from a passage
of Lysias, where the two words
ἀποδύεσθαι and ἐκδύεσθαι occur together;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Theomn.</cite></span> i. 10 (p. 117) φάσκων
θοιμάτιον ἀποδεδύσθαι ἢ τὸν χιτωνίσκον
ἐκδεδύσθαι. Here however the
sense of ἀπεκδυσάμενος is difficult.
The meaning generally assigned to it,
‘having spoiled, stripped of their
arms’, disregards the middle voice.
St Jerome is chiefly responsible for
this common error of interpretation:
for in place of the Old Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘exuens
se’</span>, which was grammatically correct,
he substituted <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘exspolians’</span> in his revised
version. In his interpretation
however he was anticipated by the
commentator Hilary, who read <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘exuens’</span>
for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘exuens se’</span> in his text. Discarding
this sense, as inconsistent with
the voice, we have the choice of two
interpretations.</p>

<p class='c034'>(1) The common interpretation of
the Latin fathers, ‘<em>putting off</em> the
body’, thus separating ἀπεκδυσάμενος
from τὰς ἀρχὰς κ.τ.λ. and understanding

been the sense adopted much earlier
in a Docetic work quoted by Hippol.
<cite>Hær.</cite> viii. 10 ψυχὴ ἐκέινη ἐν τῷ σώματι
τραφεῖσα, ἀπεκδυσαμένη τὸ σῶμα καὶ
προσηλώσασα πρὸς τὸ ξύλον καὶ θριαμβεύσασα
κ.τ.λ. It is so paraphrased
likewise in the Peshito Syriac and the
Gothic. The reading ἀπεκδυσάμενος
τὴν σάρκα καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας (omitting
τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ), found in some ancient
authorities, must be a corruption
from an earlier text, which had
inserted the gloss τὴν σάρκα after
ἀπεκδυσάμενος, while retaining τὰς
ἀρχὰς καὶ, and which seems to have
been in the hands of some of the Latin
fathers already quoted. This interpretation
has been connected with
a common metaphorical use of ἀποδύεσθαι,
signifying ‘to strip’ and so
‘to prepare for a contest’; e.g. Plut.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> 811 <span class='fss'>E</span> πρὸς πᾶσαν ἀποδύομενοι
τὴν πολιτικὴν πρᾶξιν, Diod. Sic. ii. 29
ἐπὶ φιλοσοφίαν ἀποδύντες. The serious
objection to this rendering is, that
it introduces an isolated metaphor
which is not explained or suggested
by anything in the context.</p>

<p class='c034'>(2) The common interpretation of
the Greek fathers; ‘<em>having stripped
off and put away the powers</em> of evil’,
making ἀπεκδυσάμενος govern τὰς ἀρχὰς
κ.τ.λ.  So Chrysostom, Severianus,
Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Theodoret.
This also appears to have been
the interpretation of Origen, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Matt.</cite></span>
xii. § 25 (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 544), <em>ib.</em> § 40 (p. 560),
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Ioann.</cite></span> vi. § 37 (<span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 155), <em>ib.</em> xx.
§ 29 (p. 356), though his language is
not explicit, and though his translators,
e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Libr. Ies. Hom.</cite></span> vii. § 3
(<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 413), make him say otherwise.
The meaning then will be as follows.
Christ took upon Himself our human
nature with all its temptations (Heb. iv.
15). The powers of evil gathered about
Him. Again and again they assailed
Him; but each fresh assault ended
in a new defeat. In the wilderness
He was tempted by Satan; but Satan
retired for the time baffled and
defeated (Luke iv. 13 ἀπέστη ἀπ’
αὐτοῦ ἄχρι καιροῦ). Through the
voice of His chief disciple the temptation
was renewed, and He was
entreated to decline His appointed
sufferings and death. Satan was
again driven off (Matt. xvi. 23 ὕπαγε
ὀπίσω μου, Σατανᾶ, σκάνδαλον εἶ ἐμοῦ:
comp. Matt. viii. 31). Then the last
hour came. This was the great crisis
of all, when ‘the power of darkness’
made itself felt (Luke xxii. 53 &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἡ ἐξουσία</em>&nbsp;
τοῦ σκότους; see above i. 13), when
the prince of the world asserted his
tyranny (Joh. xii. 30 &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ὁ ἄρχων</em>&nbsp; τοῦ
κόσμου). The final act in the conflict
began with the agony of Gethsemane;
it ended with the cross of Calvary.
The victory was complete. The enemy
of man was defeated. The powers of
evil, which had clung like a Nessus
robe about His humanity, were torn
off and cast aside for ever. And the
victory of mankind is involved in the
victory of Christ. In His cross we
too are divested of the poisonous
clinging garments of temptation and
sin and death; τῷ ἀποθέσθαι τὴν
θνητότητα, says Theodore, ἣν ὑπὲρ τῆς
κοινῆς ἀφεῖλεν εὐεργεσίας, ἀπεδύσατο
κἀκείνων (i.e. τῶν ἀντικειμένων δυνάμεων)
τὴν αὐθεντείαν ᾗπερ ἐκέχρηντο
καθ’ ἡμῶν. For the image of the garments
comp. Is. lxiv. 6, but especially
Zech. iii. 1 sq., ‘And he showed me
Joshua the high-priest standing before
the angel of the Lord and <em>Satan
standing at his right hand to resist
him</em>. And the Lord said unto Satan,
The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan....
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy
garments.... And He answered and
spake unto those that stood before
Him saying <em>Take away the filthy garments</em>
from him. And unto him He
said Behold, <em>I have caused thine iniquity
to pass from thee</em>’. In this
prophetic passage the image is used
of His type and namesake, the Jesus
of the Restoration, not in his own
person, but as the high-priest and representative
of a guilty but cleansed
and forgiven people, with whom he is
identified. For the metaphor of ἀπεκδυσάμενος
more especially, see Philo
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quod det. pot. ins.</cite></span> 13 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 199) ἐξαναστάντες
δὲ καὶ διερεισάμενοι τὰς ἐντέχνους
αὐτῶν περιπλοκὰς εὐμαρῶς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἐκδυσόμεθα</em>&nbsp;,
where the image in the context
is that of a wrestling bout.</p>

<p class='c034'>This interpretation is grammatical;
it accords with St Paul’s teaching; and
it is commended by the parallel uses of
the substantive in ver. 11 ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει
τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός, and of the
verb in iii. 9 ἀπεκδυσάμενοι τὸν πάλαιον
ἄνθρωπον κ.τ.λ. The ἀπέκδυσις accomplished
in us when we are baptized into
His death is a counterpart to the ἀπέκδυσις
which He accomplished by His
death. With Him indeed it was only
the temptation, with us it is the sin
as well as temptation; but otherwise
the parallel is complete. In both
cases it is a divestiture of the powers
of evil, a liberation from the dominion
of the flesh. On the other hand the
common explanation ‘spoiling’ is not
less a violation of St Paul’s usage
(iii. 9) than of grammatical rule.</p>

The word is extremely rare;
Matt. i. 19 μὴ θέλων αὐτὴν δειγματίσαι
(where it ought probably to be read

<cite>Act. Paul. et Petr.</cite> 33 ἔλεγε

example’ (παραδειγματίσαι) but signifies
simply ‘to display, publish, proclaim’.
In the context of the last

<p class='c033'>ἐν παρρησίᾳ] ‘<em>boldly</em>’, not ‘<em>publicly</em>’.
As παρρησία is ‘unreservedness, plainness
of speech’ (παν-ρησία, its opposite
being ἀρρησία ‘silence’), so while
applied still to language, it may be
opposed either (1) to ‘fear’, as John

reserve’, Joh. xi. 14, xvi.
25, 29; but ‘misgiving, apprehension’
in some form or other seems to be
always the correlative idea. Hence,
when it is transferred from words to
actions, it appears always to retain
the idea of ‘confidence, boldness’; e.g.
1 Macc. iv. 18 λήψετε τὰ σκ<sup>υ</sup>λα μετὰ

publicity may sometimes be connected
with the word as a secondary notion,
e.g. in Joh. vii. 4, where ἐν παρρησίᾳ
εἶναι ‘to assume a bold attitude’ is
opposed to ἐν κρυπτῷ ποιεῖν (comp.

<p class='c033'>θριαμβεύσας] ‘<em>leading them in triumph</em>’,
the same metaphor as in 2 Cor.
ii. 14 τῷ πάντοτε θριαμβεύοντι ἡμᾶς ἐν
τῷ Χριστῷ κ.τ.λ., where it is wrongly
translated in the A. V. ‘causeth us to
triumph’. Here however it is the defeated
powers of evil, there the subjugated
persons of men, who are led
in public, chained to the triumphal
car of Christ. This is the proper
meaning and construction of θριαμβεύειν,
as found elsewhere. This verb
takes an accusative (1) of the person
over whom the triumph is celebrated,
e.g. Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit. Arat.</cite></span> 54 τοῦτον Αἰμίλιος
ἐθριάμβευσε, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Thes. et Rom. Comp.</cite></span> 4
βασιλεῖς ἐθριάμβευσε: (2) of the spoils
exhibited in the triumph, e.g. Tatian
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Græc.</cite></span> 26 παύσασθε λόγους ἀλλοτρίους
θριαμβεύοντες καί, ὥσπερ ὁ κολοιός,
οὐκ ἰδίοις ἐπικοσμούμενοι πτεροῖς: (3)
more rarely of the substance of the
triumph, e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit. Camill.</cite></span> 30 ὁ δὲ
Κάμιλλος ἐθριάμβευσε ... τὸν ἀπολωλυίας
σωτῆρα πατρίδος γενόμενον, i.e. ‘in the
character of his country’s saviour’.
The passive θριαμβεύεσθαι is ‘to be led
in triumph’, ‘to be triumphed over’,
e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit. C. Marc.</cite></span> 35. So the Latins
say <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘triumphare aliquem’</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘triumphari’</span>.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν αὐτῷ] i.e. τῷ σταυρῷ: comp.
Ephes. ii. 16 ἀποκαταλλάξῃ τοὺς ἀμφοτέρους
... διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ. The violence
of the metaphor is its justification.
The paradox of the crucifixion is thus
placed in the strongest light—triumph
in helplessness and glory in shame.
The convict’s gibbet is the victor’s
car.</p>

<p class='c034'>16–19. ‘Seeing then that the bond
is cancelled, that the law of ordinances
is repealed, beware of subjecting yourselves
to its tyranny again. Suffer no
man to call you to account in the
matter of eating or drinking, or again
of the observance of a festival or a
new moon or a sabbath. These are
only shadows thrown in advance, only
types of things to come. The substance,
the reality, in every case belongs
to the Gospel of Christ. The
prize is now fairly within your reach.
Do not suffer yourselves to be robbed
of it by any stratagem of the false
teachers. Their religion is an officious
humility which displays itself in
the worship of angels. They make a
parade of their visions, but they are
following an empty phantom. They
profess humility, but they are puffed
up with their vaunted wisdom, which
is after all only the mind of the flesh.
Meanwhile they have substituted inferior
spiritual agencies for the One
true Mediator, the Eternal Word.
Clinging to these lower intelligences,
they have lost their hold of the Head;
they have severed their connexion
with Him, on whom the whole body
depends; from whom it derives its
vitality, and to whom it owes its unity,
being supplied with nourishment and
knit together in one by means of the
several joints and attachments, so that
it grows with a growth which comes
from God Himself.’</p>

<p class='c034'>16 sq. The two main tendencies of
the Colossian heresy are discernible
in this warning (vv. 16–19), as they
were in the previous statement (vv. 9–15).
Here however the order is
reversed. The practical error, an excessive
ritualism and ascetic rigour,
is first dealt with (vv. 16, 17); the
theological error, the interposition of
angelic mediators, follows after (vv.
18, 19). The first is the substitution
of a shadow for the substance; the
second is the preference of an inferior
member to the head. The reversal of
order is owing to the connexion of the
paragraphs; the opening subject in
the second paragraph being a continuation
of the concluding subject in
the first, by the figure called chiasm:
comp. Gal. iv. 5.</p>

<p class='c034'>κρινέτω] not ‘<em>condemn you</em>’, but
‘<em>take you to task</em>’; as e.g. Rom. xiv.
3 sq. The judgment may or may not
end in an acquittal; but in any case
it is wrong, since these matters ought
not to be taken as the basis of a judgment.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν βρώσει κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>in eating and
in drinking</em>’; Rom. xiv. 17 οὐ γάρ

πόσις, ἀλλὰ δικαιοσύνη κ.τ.λ., Heb. ix.
10 ἐπὶ βρώμασιν καὶ πόμασιν καὶ διαφόροις
βαπτισμοῖς, δικαίωματα σαρκός,
comp. 1 Cor. viii. 8 βρῶμα δὲ ἡμᾶς οὐ
παραστήσει τῷ Θεῷ κ.τ.λ. The first
indication that the Mosaic distinctions
of things clean and unclean should be
abolished is given by our Lord Himself:
Mark vii. 14 sq. (the correct reading
in ver. 19 being καθαρίζων πάντα τὰ
βρώματα). They were afterwards formally
annulled by the vision which appeared
to St Peter: Acts x. 11 sq.
The ordinances of the Mosaic law
applied almost exclusively to meats.
It contained no prohibitions respecting
drinks except in a very few cases;
e.g. of the priests ministering in the
tabernacle (Lev. x. 9), of liquids contained
in unclean vessels etc. (Lev.
xi. 34, 36), and of Nazarite vows
(Num. vi. 3). These directions, taken
in connexion with the rigid observances
which the later Jews had
grafted on them (Matt. xxiii. 24),
would be sufficient to explain the expression,
when applied to the Mosaic
law by itself, as in Heb. <em>l.c.</em> The rigour
of the Colossian false teachers however,
like that of their Jewish prototypes
the Essenes, doubtless went far
beyond the injunctions of the law. It
is probable that they forbad wine and
animal food altogether: see the introduction
pp. 86, 104 sq.   For allusions
in St Paul to similar observances not
required by the law, see Rom. xiv. 2

The σάββατα here gives by name the
<em>weekly</em> holy-day, which is there indicated
more generally by ἡμέραι.</p>

<p class='c034'>νεομηνίας] See Num. xxviii. 11 sq.
The forms νεομηνία and νουμηνία seem
to be used indifferently in the common
dialect, though the latter is more
common. In the Attic νουμηνία alone
was held to be correct; see Lobeck
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phryn.</cite></span> p. 148. On the whole the
preference should perhaps be given
to νεομηνίας here, as supported by
some authorities which are generally
trustworthy in matters of orthography,
and as being the less usual form in
itself.</p>

<p class='c034'>σαββάτων] ‘<em>a sabbath-day</em>’, not, as
the A.V., ‘<em>sabbath days</em>’; for the coordinated
words ἑορτῆς, νεομηνίας, are
in the singular. The word σάββατα
is derived from the Aramaic (as distinguished
from the Hebrew) form
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">שבתא</span>, and accordingly preserves the
Aramaic termination in α. Hence it
was naturally declined as a plural
noun, σάββατα, σαββάτων. The general
use of σάββατα, when a single sabbath-day
was meant, will appear from
such passages as Jos. <cite>Ant.</cite> i. 1. 1 ἄγομεν
τὴν ἡμέραν, προσαγορεύοντες αὐτὴν
σάββατα, <em>ib.</em> iii. 10. 1 ἑβδόμην ἡμέραν
ἥτις σάββατα καλεῖται, Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span>

i. 9. 69 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘hodie tricesima sabbata’</span>. In
the New Testament σάββατα is only
once used distinctly of more than a
single day, and there the plurality of
meaning is brought out by the attached
numeral; Acts xvii. 2 ἐπὶ σάββατα
τρία.</p>

<p class='c034'>On the observance of days and seasons
see again Gal. iv. 10, Rom. xiv.
5, 6. A strong anti-Judaic view on the
subject is expressed in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist. ad

τοῦ τῇ φύσει κυρίου λόγου Θεοῦ,
ἀεί ἐστιν αὐτοῦ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις καὶ ἀεὶ
ἄγει κυριακὰς ἡμέρας, and he then goes
on to explain what is the παρασκευή,
the πάσχα, the πεντεκοστή, of such a
man. The observance of sacred times
was an integral part of the old dispensation.
Under the new they have
ceased to have any value, except as a
means to an end. The great principle
that ‘the sabbath was made for man
and not man for the sabbath’, though
underlying the Mosaic ordinances,
was first distinctly pronounced by our
Lord. The setting apart of special
days for the service of God is a confession
of our imperfect state, an
avowal that we cannot or do not devote
our whole time to Him. Sabbaths
will then ultimately be superseded,
when our life becomes one
eternal sabbath. Meanwhile the Apostle’s
rebuke warns us against attributing
to any holy days whatever a
meaning and an importance which is
alien to the spirit of the New Covenant.
Bengel on the text writes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Sabbatum
non laudatur, non imperatur;
dominica memoratur, non præcipitur.
Qui profundius in mundi negotiis hærent,
his utilis et necessarius est dies
definitus: qui semper sabbatizant,
majori libertate gaudent’.</span> Yes: but
these last are just they who will most
scrupulously restrict their liberty, so
as ἀπρόσκοποι γίνεσθαι.</p>

<p class='c034'>17. Two ideas are prominent in
this image. (1) The contrast between
the ordinances of the Law and the
teaching of the Gospel, as the shadow
and the substance respectively; Philo
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Conf. ling.</cite></span> 37 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 434) νομίσαντας

ἄρ’ ἦσαν, οὐ πράγματα. (2) The
conception of the shadow as thrown
before the substance (ἡ δὲ σκιὰ προτρέχει
τοῦ σώματος, says a Greek commentator),
so that the Law was a type and
presage of the Gospel; Heb. x. 1 σκιὰν
ἔχων ὁ νόμος τῶν μελλόντων ἀγαθῶν
(comp. viii. 5). Thus it implies both
the <em>unsubstantiality</em> and the <em>supersession</em>
of the Mosaic ritual.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἅ] ‘<em>which things</em>’, whether distinctions
of meats or observances of
times. If the other reading ὅ be taken,
it will refer to the preceding
sentence generally, as if the antecedent
were ‘the whole system of ordinances’.</p>

<p class='c033'>τὸ δὲ σῶμα κ.τ.λ.] As the shadow
belonged to Moses, so ‘<em>the substance
belongs to Christ</em>’; i.e. the reality,
the antitype, in each case is found in
the Christian dispensation. Thus the
passover typifies the atoning sacrifice;
the unleavened bread, the purity and
sincerity of the true believer; the
pentecostal feast, the ingathering of
the first fruits; the sabbath, the rest
of God’s people; etc.</p>

<p class='c034'>18. The Christian’s career is the
contest of the stadium (δρόμος, Acts
xx. 24, 2 Tim. iv. 7); Christ is the
umpire, the dispenser of the rewards
(2 Tim. iv. 8); life eternal is the bay
wreath, the victor’s prize (βραβεῖον,
1 Cor. ix. 24, Phil. iii. 14). The Colossians
were in a fair way to win this
prize; they had entered the lists duly;
they were running bravely: but the
false teachers, thrusting themselves in
the way, attempted to trip them up
or otherwise impede them in the race,
and thus to rob them of their just
reward. For the idea of καταβραβεύετω

(p. 43) καταβραβεύει αὐτόν, ὥς φασιν
οἱ πάλαιοι, ib. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Opusc.</cite></span> 277, etc. The
false teachers at Colossæ are not regarded
as umpires nor as successful
rivals, but simply as persons frustrating
those who otherwise would have
won the prize. The word καταβραβεύειν
is wide enough to include such. The
two compounds καταβραβεύειν and παραβραβεύειν
(Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 535 <span class='fss'>C</span> οἱ
παραβραβεύοντες ἐν τοῖς ἀγῶσι) only
differ in this respect, that <em>deprivation</em> is
the prominent idea in the former word
and <em>trickery</em> in the latter. Jerome,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist.</cite></span> cxxi. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad Algas.</cite></span> (<span class='fss'>I</span>. p. 879), sets
down this word, which he wrongly
interprets <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘bravium accipiat adversum
vos’</span>, as one of St Paul’s Cilicisms.
The passages quoted (whether the
document in the Midias be authentic
or not) are sufficient to show that
this statement is groundless.</p>

<p class='c034'>θέλων ἐν] ‘<em>taking delight in</em>’, ‘<em>devoting

is common in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span>, most frequently

valid objection has been urged. Otherwise
θέλων is taken absolutely, and
various senses have been assigned to
it, such as ‘imperiously’ or ‘designedly’
or ‘wilfully’ or ‘gladly, readily’;
but these are either unsupported by
usage or inappropriate to the context.

ἐλθών; but the passages quoted

<p class='c034'>ταπεινοφροσύνῃ] Humility is a vice
with heathen moralists, but a virtue
with Christian Apostles; see the note
on Phil. ii. 3. In this passage, which
(with ver. 23) forms the sole exception
to the general language of the Apostles,
the divergence is rather apparent
than real. The disparagement is
in the accompaniments and not in the
word itself. Humility, when it becomes
self-conscious, ceases to have
any value; and self-consciousness at
least, if not affectation, is implied by
θέλων ἐν. Moreover the character of
the ταπεινοφροσύνη in this case is further
defined as θρησκεία τῶν ἀγγέλων,
which was altogether a perversion of
the truth.</p>

<p class='c033'>θρησκείᾳ] This word is closely connected
with the preceding by the vinculum
of the same preposition. There
was an officious parade of humility in
selecting these lower beings as intercessors,
rather than appealing directly
to the throne of grace. The
word refers properly to the external
rites of religion, and so gets to signify
an over-scrupulous devotion to
external forms; as in Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quod det.

θρησκεία, together occur four
times (Wisd. xi. 16, xiv. 16, 18, 27),

is to idolatrous or false worship.
Indeed generally the usage of the
word exhibits a tendency to a bad
sense.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἃ ἑόρακεν κ.τ.λ.] literally ‘<em>invading

over his visions’. For this sense of
ἐμβατεύειν, which takes either a genitive
or a dative or an accusative, comp.
Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Plant. Noe</cite></span> ii. 19 (i. p. 341)

τῷ αὐτῷ βιβλίῷ ἀμφότεροι ἐμβατεύετέ
τι, the reading may be doubtful. But
though ἃ ἑόρακεν singly might mean
‘his visions’, and ἐμβατεύων ‘busying
himself with’, the combination ‘invading
what he has seen’, thus interpreted,
is so harsh and incongruous
as to be hardly possible; and there
was perhaps some corruption in the
text prior to all existing authorities
(see the note on Phil. ii. 1 for a parallel
case). Did the Apostle write
)έωρᾳ (or αἴωρᾳ) κενεμβατεύων? In this
case the existing text <span class="uncial">αεωρακενεμ
βατευων</span> might be explained partly
by an attempt to correct the form
)εώρᾳ into αἰώρᾳ or conversely, and
partly by the perplexity of transcribers
when confronted with such unusual
words. This reading had suggested
itself to me independently without
the knowledge that, so far as regards
the latter word, it had been anticipated
by others in the conjecture ἃ
ἑώρα (or ἃ ἑώρακεν) κενεμβατεύων. The
word κενεμβατεῖν ‘to walk on emptiness’,
‘to tread the air’, and so metaphorically
(like αἐροβατεῖν, αἰθεροβατεῖν,
αἰθερεμβατεῖν, etc.) ‘to indulge in
vain speculations’, is not an uncommon
word. For its metaphorical sense especially
see Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 336 <span class='fss'>F</span> οὕτως ἐρέμβετο

Though the precise form κενεμβατεύειν

&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>κατὰ κενοῦ βαίνοντα</em>&nbsp;. The
first and last passages more especially
present striking parallels, and show
how germane to St Paul’s subject
these ideas of ‘suspension or balancing
in the air’ (ἐώρα or αἰώρα) and
‘treading the void’ (κενεμβατεύειν)
would be, as expressing at once the
spiritual pride and the emptiness of
these speculative mystics; see also <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de

The substantive, ἐώρα or αἰώρα, is used
sometimes of the instrument for suspending,
sometimes of the position of
suspension. In this last sense it describes
the poising of a bird, the floating
of a boat on the waters, the balancing
on a rope, and the like. Hence
its expressiveness when used as a metaphor.</p>

<p class='c034'>In the received text a negative is
inserted, ἃ μὴ ἑώρακεν ἐμβατεύων.
This gives a very adequate sense ‘<em>intruding

<p class='c034'>διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>through the
junctures and ligaments</em>.’ Galen, when
describing the structure of the human
frame, more than once specifies the
elements of union as twofold: the
body owes its compactness partly to
the <em>articulation</em>, partly to the <em>attachment</em>;
e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 734 (ed. Kühn)

&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἄρθρον</em>&nbsp;, ὁ δὲ ἕτερος κατὰ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>σύμφυσιν</em>&nbsp;.
Similarly, though with a more general
reference, Aristotle speaks of two
kinds of union, which he describes
as ἁφή ‘contact’ and σύμφυσις
‘cohesion’ respectively; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Metaph.</cite></span> iv. 4

ὅσα ἐστιν ἁφῇ καὶ μὴ συμφύσει. The
relation of contiguous surfaces and
the connexion of different parts together
effect structural unity. This
same distinction appears in the Apostle’s
language here. Contact and
attachment are the primary ideas in
ἁφαί and σύνδεσμοι respectively.</p>

<p class='c034'>Of the function of ἁφή, ‘contact’, in
physiology (περὶ ἁφῆς τῆς ἐν τοῖς φυσικοῖς)
Aristotle speaks at some length
in one passage, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Gen. et Corr.</cite></span> i. 6
(p. 322 sq.). It may be mentioned,
as illustrating St Paul’s image, that
Aristotle in this passage lays great
stress on the mutual sympathy and
influence of the parts in contact, describing
them as παθητικὰ καὶ ποιητικά
and as κινητικὰ καὶ κινητὰ ὑπ’ ἀλληλῶν.
Elsewhere, like St Paul here, he uses
the plural αἱ ἁφαί; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Cælo</cite></span> i. 11 (p.

ἁφὰς καὶ τῷ σώματι ῥωμαλέον. It is
quite clear from these passages of
Aristotle, more especially from the
distinction of ἁφαί and πόροι, that αἱ
ἁφαί are the joinings, the junctures.
When applied to the human body
they would be ‘joints,’ provided that
we use the word accurately of the relations
between contiguous limbs, and
not loosely (as it is often used) of the
parts of the limbs themselves in the
neighbourhood of the contact. Hippocrates
indeed used ἁφαί as a physiological
term in a different sense, employing
it as a synonyme for ἅμματα
i.e. the fasciculi of muscles (see Galen
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>XIX.</span> p. 87), but this use was quite
exceptional and can have no place here.
Thus αἱ ἁφαί will be almost a synonyme
for τὰ ἄρθρα, differing however (1) as
being more wide and comprehensive,
and (2) as not emphasizing so strongly
the <em>adaptation</em> of the contiguous
parts.</p>

<p class='c034'>The considerations just urged seem
decisive as to the meaning of the
word. Some eminent modern critics
however explain αἱ ἁφαί to be ‘the
senses’, following Theodoret on Ephes.
iv. 16 ἁφὴν δὲ τὴν ἄισθησιν προσηγόρευσεν,
ἐπειδὴ καὶ αὕτη μία τῶν πέντε
αἰσθήσεων, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ μέρους τὸ πᾶν
ὠνόμασε. St Chrysostom had led the
way to this interpretation, though his
language is less explicit than Theodoret’s.
To such a meaning however
there are fatal objections. (1)
This sense of ἁφή is wholly unsupported.
It is true that touch lies at
the root of all sensations, and that
this fact was recognised by ancient
physiologists: e.g. Aristot. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Anim.</cite></span>
i. 13 (p. 435) ἄνευ μὲν γὰρ ἁφῆς οὐδεμίαν
ἐνδέχεται ἄλλην ἄισθησιν ἔχειν. But
here the connexion ends; and unless
more cogent examples not hitherto adduced
are forthcoming, we are justified
in saying that αἱ ἁφαί could no more
be used for αἱ αἰσθήσεις, than in
English ‘the touches’ could be taken
as a synonyme for ‘the senses.’ (2) The
image would be seriously marred by
such a meaning. The ἁφαί and σύνδεσμοι
would no longer be an exhaustive
description of the elements
of union in the anatomical structure;
the conjunction of things so incongruous
under the vinculum of the
same article and preposition, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>διὰ τῶν</em>&nbsp;
ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων, would be unnatural;
and the intrusion of the
‘senses’ would be out of place, where
the result specified is the supply of
nourishment (ἐπιχορηγούμενον) and the
compacting of the parts (συμβιβαζόμενον).
(3) All the oldest versions, the
Latin, the Syriac, and the Memphitic,
explain it otherwise, so as to refer in
some way to the connexion of the
parts of the body; e.g. in the Old
Latin it is rendered <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nexus</em></span> here and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>junctura</em></span> in Ephes. iv. 16.</p>

<p class='c034'>συνδέσμων] ‘<em>bands</em>,’ ‘<em>ligaments</em>.’ The
Greek σύνδεσμος, like the English ‘ligament,’
has a general and a special sense.
In its general and comprehensive meaning
it denotes any of the connecting
bands which strap the body together,
such as muscles or tendons or ligaments
properly so called; in its special
and restricted use it is a ‘ligament’
in the technical sense; comp. Galen
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 369 σύνδεσμος γάρ ἐστιν, ὁ
γοῦν ἰδίως, οὐ κοινῶς ὀνομαζόμενος, σῶμα
νευρῶδες ἐξ ὀστοῦ μὲν ὁρμώμενον
πάντως διαπεφυκὸς δὲ ἢ εἰς ὀστοῦν ἢ εἰς
μῦν. Of the σύνδεσμοι or ligaments
properly so called Galen describes at
length the several functions and uses,
more especially as binding and holding
together the διαρθρώσεις; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> 236,

ed. Gale). In  our text indeed σύνδεσμοι
must be taken in its comprehensive
sense; but the relation of the
ἁφαί to the σύνδεσμοι in St Paul still
remains the same as that of the διαρθρώσεις
to the σύνδεσμοι in Galen.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐπιχορηγούμενον κ.τ.λ.] The two functions
performed by the ἁφαί and σύνδεσμοι
are <em>first</em> the supply of nutriment
etc. (ἐπιχορηγούμενον), and <em>secondly</em>
the compacting of the frame
(συνβιβαζόμενον). In other words
they are the communication of life
and energy, and the preservation of
unity and order. The <em>source</em> of all (ἐξ
οὗ) is Christ Himself the Head; but
the <em>channels</em> of communication (διὰ
τῶν κ.τ.λ.) are the different members
of His body, in their relation one to
another. For ἐπιχορηγούμενον ‘bountifully
furnished’ see the note on Gal.
iii. 5. Somewhat similarly Aristotle
speaks of σῶμα κάλλιστα πεφυκὸς καὶ
κεχορηγημένον, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pol.</cite></span> iv. 1 (p. 1288).
For examples of χορηγία applied to
functions of the bodily organs, see
Galen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 617 ἐν ταῖς εἰσπνοαῖς

i. 81 τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς τροφῆς ἐξυδαρούμενον
χορηγεῖται πρὸς γένεσιν τοῦ πάθους.
For συνβιβαζόμενον, ‘joined together,
compacted’, see the note on
ii. 2. In the parallel passage, Ephes.
iv. 16, this part of the image is more
distinctly emphasized, συναρμολούμενον
καὶ συνβιβαζόμενον. The difference
corresponds to the different aims of
the two epistles. In the Colossian
letter the vital connexion with the
Head is the main theme; in the
Ephesian, the unity in diversity among
the members.</p>

is truly united with the Infinite; the
end which the false teachers strove in
vain to compass is attained; the Gospel
vindicates itself as the true theanthropism,
after which the human
heart is yearning and the human intellect
is feeling. See above p. 183
sq. With this conclusion of the sentence
contrast the parallel passage
Ephes. iv. 16 τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ σώματος

endings are determined by the different

<p class='c034'>The discoveries of modern physiology
have invested the Apostle’s
language with far greater distinctness
and force than it can have worn to
his own contemporaries. Any exposition
of the nervous system more
especially reads like a commentary on
his image of the relations between the
body and the head. At every turn we
meet with some fresh illustration
which kindles it with a flood of light.
The volition communicated from the
brain to the limbs, the sensations of
the extremities telegraphed back to
the brain, the absolute mutual sympathy
between the head and the
members, the instantaneous paralysis
ensuing on the interruption of continuity,
all these add to the completeness
and life of the image. But
the following passages will show how
even ancient scientific speculation was
feeling after those physiological truths
which the image involves; Hippocr.

Plato had made the head the
central organ of the reason (<cite>Tim.</cite> 69
sq.: see Grote’s <cite>Plato</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span> pp. 272,
287, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Aristotle</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 179 sq.), if indeed
the speculations of the Timæus
may be regarded as giving his serious
physiological views; but he had postulated
other centres of the emotions
and appetites, the heart and the
abdomen. Aristotle, while rightly refusing
to localize the mind as mind,
had taken a retrograde step physiologically,
when he transferred the
centre of sensation from the brain to
the heart; e.g. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Part. Anim.</cite></span> ii. 10
(p. 656). Galen, criticizing his predecessors,
says of Aristotle δῆλός ἐστι
κατεγνωκὼς μὲν αὐτοῦ (i.e. τοῦ ἐγκεφάλοὐ
τελέαν ἀχρηστίαν, φανερῶς δ’ ὁμολογεῖν
αἰδούμενος (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 625). The
Stoics however (Ζήνων καὶ Χρύσιππος
ἅμα τῷ σφετέρῳ χορῷ παντί) were even
worse offenders; and in reply to them
more especially Galen elsewhere discusses
the question πότερον ἐγκέφαλος

sq. Bearing in mind all this diversity
of opinion among ancient physiologists,
we cannot fail to be struck in the
text not only with the correctness of
the image but also with the propriety
of the terms; and we are forcibly
reminded that among the Apostle’s
most intimate companions at this time
was one whom he calls ‘the beloved
physician’ (iv. 14).</p>

<p class='c034'><a href='#II_20'>20–23.</a> ‘You died with Christ to
your old life. All mundane relations
have ceased for you. Why then do
you—you who have attained your
spiritual manhood—submit still to
the rudimentary discipline of children?
Why do you—you who are citizens of
heaven—bow your necks afresh to
the tyranny of material ordinances, as
though you were still living in the
world? It is the same old story again;
the same round of hard, meaningless,
vexatious prohibitions, ‘Handle not,’
‘Taste not,’ ‘Touch not.’ What folly!
When all these things—these meats
and drinks and the like—are earthly,
perishable, wholly trivial and unimportant!
They are used, and there
is an end of them. What is this, but
to draw down upon yourselves the
denunciations uttered by the prophet
of old? What is this but to abandon
God’s word for precepts which are
issued by human authority and inculcated
by human teachers? All such
things have a show of wisdom, I grant.
There is an officious parade of religious
devotion, an eager affectation
of humility; there is a stern ascetic
rigour, which ill-treats the body; but
there is nothing of any real value
to check indulgence of the flesh.’</p>

<p class='c034'>20. From the theological tenets of
the false teachers the Apostle turns
to the ethical—from the objects of
their worship to the principles of
their conduct. The baptism into
Christ, he argues, is death to the
world. The Christian has passed
away to another sphere of existence.
Mundane ordinances have ceased to
have any value for him, because his
mundane life has ended. They belong
to the category of the perishable;
he has been translated to the region
of the eternal. It is therefore a denial
of his Christianity to subject himself
again to their tyranny, to return once
more to the dominion of the world.
See again the note on iii. 1.</p>

<p class='c034'>εἰ ἀπεθάνετε] ‘<em>if ye died</em>, when ye
were baptized into Christ.’ For this
connexion between baptism and death
see the notes on ii. 11, iii. 3. This
death has many aspects in St Paul’s
teaching. It is not only a dying <em>with</em>
Christ, 2 Tim. ii. 11 εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν;
but it is also a dying to or from
something. This is sometimes represented
as <em>sin</em>, Rom. vi. 2 ὁίτινες ἀπεθάνομεν

Rom. vii. 6 κατηργήθημεν ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου
ἀποθανόντες, Gal. ii. 19 διὰ νόμου
νόμῳ ἀπέθανον; sometimes still more
widely as the <em>world</em>, regarded as the
sphere of all material rules and all
mundane interests, so here and iii. 3
ἀπεθάνετε γάρ. In all cases St Paul
uses the aorist ἀπέθανον, never the
perfect τέθνηκα; for he wishes to emphasize
the one absolute <em>crisis</em>, which
was marked by the change of changes.
When the aorist is wanted, the compound
verb ἀποθνήσκειν is used; when
the perfect, the simple verb θήσκειν;

8, xv. 36, 3 Macc. iv. 11. Elsewhere
it is applied most commonly to the

(comp. § 4), Epict. iii. 7. 17 sq.
εἰ θέλεις εἶναι φιλόσοφος ... δογματίζων
τὰ αἰσχρά. Here it would include
alike the δόγματα of the Mosaic law
(ver. 14) and the δόγματα of the ‘philosophy’
denounced above (ver. 8).
Both are condemned; the one as superseded
though once authoritative, the
other as wholly vexatious and unwarrantable.
Examples are given in
the following verse, μὴ ἅψῃ κ.τ.λ.
For the construction here, where
the more remote object, which would
stand in the dative with the active
voice (2 Macc. x. 8 ἐδογμάτισαν ... τῷ
τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἔθνει), becomes the
nominative of the passive, compare
χρηματίζεσθαι Matt. ii. 12, 22, διακονεῖσθαι
Mark x. 45, and see Winer
§ xxxix. p. 326, A. Buttmann p. 163,
Kühner § 378, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 109.</p>

<p class='c034'>21. Μὴ ἅψῃ κ.τ.λ.] The Apostle disparagingly
repeats the prohibitions of
the false teachers in their own words,
‘Handle not, neither taste, neither
touch.’ The rabbinical passages quoted
in Schöttgen show how exactly St
Paul’s language reproduces, not only
the spirit, but even the form, of these
injunctions. The Latin commentators,
Hilary and Pelagius, suppose
these prohibitions to be the Apostle’s
own, thus making a complete shipwreck
of the sense. So too St Ambrose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Noe et Arca</cite></span> 25 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 267), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Abr.</cite></span> i.
6 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 300). We may infer from the
language of St Augustine who argues
against it, that this was the popular
interpretation in his day: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist.</cite></span> cxix.
(<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 512) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘tanquam præceptum putatur
apostoli, nescio quid tangere,
gustare, attaminare, prohibentis.’</span> The
ascetic tendency of the age thus
fastened upon a slight obscurity in
the Greek and made the Apostle
recommend the very practices which
he disparaged. For a somewhat similar
instance of a misinterpretation
commonly received see the note on
τοῖς δόγμασιν ver. 14. Jerome however
(<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 878) had rightly interpreted
the passage, illustrating it by the precepts
of the Talmud. At a still earlier
date Tertullian, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Adv. Marc.</cite></span> v. 19,
gives the correct interpretation.</p>

<p class='c034'>These prohibitions relate to defilement
contracted in divers ways by
contact with impure objects. Some
were doubtless reenactments of the
Mosaic law; while others would be
exaggerations or additions of a rigorous
asceticism, such as we find among
the Essene prototypes of these Colossian
heretics, e.g. the avoidance of oil,
of wine, or of flesh-meat, the shunning
of contact with a stranger or a religious
inferior, and the like; see pp.
<a href='#Page_85'>85</a> sq. For the religious bearing of
this asceticism, as springing from the
<em>dualism</em> of these heretical teachers,
see above pp. 79, 104 sq.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἅψῃ] The difference between ἅπτεσθαι
and θιγγάνειν is not great, and in
some passages where they occur together,
it is hard to distinguish them:
e.g. Exod. xix. 12 προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς τοῦ
ἀναβῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄρος καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>θιγεῖν</em>&nbsp; τι αὐτοῦ·

i. 8 (p. 326) διὰ τί οὐ γίγνεται &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἁψάμενα</em>&nbsp;
ἕν, ὥσπερ ὕδωρ ὕδατος ὅταν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>θίγη</em>&nbsp;|;
Dion Chrys. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Or.</cite></span> xxxiv. (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 50) οἱ
δ’ ἐκ παρέργου προσίασιν ἁπτόμενοι

αὐτῆς ἐκ τοῦ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἅπτεσθαι</em>&nbsp; καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>θιγγάνειν</em>&nbsp;.
But ἅπτεσθαι is the stronger
word of the two. This arises from
the fact that it frequently suggests,
though it does not necessarily involve,
the idea of a voluntary or conscious
effort, ‘to take hold of’–a suggestion
which is entirely wanting to the colourless
word θιγγάνειν; comp. Themist.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Paraphr. Arist.</cite></span> 94 ἡ τῶν ζώων
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἁφὴ</em>&nbsp; κρίσις ἐστὶ καὶ ἀντίληψις τοῦ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>θιγγάνοντος</em>&nbsp;.
Hence in Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Cyrop.</cite></span> i. 3.
5 ὅτι σε, φάναι, ὁρῶ, ὅταν μὲν τοῦ ἄρτου
ἅψῃ, εἰς οὐδὲν τὴν χεῖρα ἀποψώμενον,
ὅταν δὲ τούτων τινὸς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>θίγῃς</em>&nbsp;, εὐθὺς ἀποκαθαίρει
τὴν χεῖρα εἰς τὰ χειρόμακτρα κ.τ.λ.
Thus the words chosen in the Latin Versions,
<em>tangere</em> for ἅπτεσθαι and <em>attaminare</em>
or <em>contrectare</em> for θιγεῖν, are unfortunate,
and ought to be transposed.
Our English Version, probably influenced
by the Latin, has erred in the
same direction, translating ἅπτεσθαι
by ‘touch’ and θιγεῖν by ‘handle’.
Here again they must be transposed.
‘Handle’ is too strong a word for either;
though in default of a better it
may stand for ἅπτεσθαι, which it more
nearly represents. Thus the two words
ἅψῃ and θίγῃς being separate in meaning,
γεύσῃ may well interpose; and the
three together will form a descending
series, so that, as Beza (quoted in
Trench <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>N. T. Syn.</cite></span> § xvii. p. 57) well
expresses it, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘decrescente semper
oratione, intelligatur crescere superstitio’</span>.</p>

<p class='c034'>On the other hand ἅψῃ has been
interpreted here as referring to the
relation of husband and wife, as e.g.
in 1 Cor. vii. 1 γυναικὸς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι;
and the prohibition would then be
illustrated by the teaching of the heretics
in 1 Tim. iv. 3 κωλύοντων γαμεῖν.
But, whatever likelihood there may be
that the Colossian false teachers also
held this doctrine (see above p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a> sq.),
it nowhere appears in the context,
and we should not expect so important
a topic to be dismissed thus cursorily.
Moreover θιγγάνειν is used as
commonly in this meaning as ἅπτεσθαι
(see Gataker <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op. Crit.</cite></span> p. 79, and examples
might be multiplied); so that
all ground for assigning it to ἅπτεσθαι
especially is removed. Both ἅπτεσθαι
and θιγγάνειν refer to defilement
incurred through the sense of
touch, though in different degrees;
‘Handle not, nor yet taste, nor even
touch.’</p>

<p class='c034'>22. ‘Only consider what is the real
import of this scrupulous avoidance.
Why, you are attributing an inherent
value to things which are fleeting;
you yourselves are citizens of eternity,
and yet your thoughts are absorbed
in the perishable’.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἅ] ‘<em>which things</em>’, i.e. the meats
and drinks and other material objects,
regarded as impure to the touch.
The antecedent to ἅ is implicitly
involved in the prohibitions μὴ ἅψῃ
κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐστιν εἰς φθορὰν] ‘<em>are destined for
corruption</em>’. For similar expressions
see Acts viii. 20 ἔιη εἰς ἀπωλείαν
(comp. ver. 23 εἰς χολὴν πικρίας καὶ
σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας ... ὄντἀ, 2 Πετ. ιι. 12
[Γρεεκ: γεγεννημένα ... εἰς ἅλωσιν καὶ φθοράν.
For the word φθορά, involving the idea
of ‘decomposition’, see the note on Gal.
vi. 8. The expression here corresponds
to εἰς ἀφεδρῶνα ἐκβάλλεται (ἐκπορεύεταἰ,
Matt. xv. 17, Mark vii. 19.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῇ ἀποχρήσει] ‘<em>in the consuming</em>’.
While the verb ἀποχρῶμαι is common,
the substantive ἀπόχρησις is extremely
rare: Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 267 <span class='fss'>F</span> χαίρειν ταῖς
τοιάυταις ἀποχρήσεσι καὶ συστολαῖς τῶν
περιττῶν (i.e. ‘by such modes of consuming
and abridging superfluities’),
Dion. Hal. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>A. R.</cite></span> i. 58  ἐν ἀποχρήσει
γῆς μοίρας. The unusual word was
chosen for its expressiveness: the χρῆσις
here was an ἀπόχρησις; the things
could not be used without rendering
them unfit for further use. The subtlety
of the expression in the original
cannot be reproduced in any translation.</p>

<p class='c034'>On the other hand the clause is
sometimes interpreted as a continuation
of the language of the ascetic
teachers; ‘Touch not things which all
lead to ruin by their abuse’. This interpretation
however has nothing to
recommend it. It loses the point of
the Apostle’s argument; while it puts
upon εἶναι εἰς φθοράν a meaning which
is at least not natural.</p>

<p class='c034'>κατὰ κ.τ.λ.] connected directly with

<p class='c033'>τὰ ἐντάλματα κ.τ.λ.] The absence of
both preposition and article before διδασκαλίας
shows that the two words
are closely connected. They are placed
here in their proper order; for ἐντάλματα
describes the source of authority
and διδασκαλίας the medium of communication.
The expression is taken
ultimately from Isaiah xxix. 13, where
the words run in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span>, μάτην δὲ
σέβονταί με, διδάσκοντες ἐντάλματα ἀνθρώπων
καὶ διδασκαλίας. The Evangelists
(Matt. xv. 9, Mark vii. 7), quoting
the passage, substitute in the latter
clause διδάσκοντες διδασκαλίας ἐντάλματα
ἀνθρώπων.</p>

<p class='c034'>The coincidences in St Paul’s language
here with our Lord’s words as
related in the Gospels (Matt. xv.
1–20, Mark vii. 1–23) are striking,
and suggest that the Apostle had this
discourse in his mind. (1) Both alike
argue against these vexatious ordinances
from the <em>perishableness</em> of
meats. (2) Both insist upon the indifference
of such things in themselves.
In Mark vii. 19 the Evangelist emphasizes
the importance of our Lord’s
words on this occasion, as practically
abolishing the Mosaic distinction of
meats by declaring all alike to be
clean (καθαρίζων; see the note on ver.
16). (3) Both alike connect such ordinances
with the practices condemned
in the prophetic denunciation of
Isaiah.</p>

<p class='c034'>λόγον μὲν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>having a reputation

The corresponding member, which

the oppositive clause being
postponed and appearing later in a
new form, οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινι κ.τ.λ. Such
suppressions are common in classical
writers, more especially in Plato; see
Kühner § 531, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 813 sq., Jelf § 766,

<p class='c034'>In this sentence λόγον ἔχοντα σοφίας

two senses are recognised by Aristotle,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eth. Nic.</cite></span> i. 13 (p. 1102), where he
distinguishes the meaning of the expressions
ἔχειν λόγον τοῦ πατρὸς ἢ τῶν

(<span class='fss'>B</span>) Two as applied to the <em>object of
thought</em>. (iii) ‘To have the credit or
reputation of’, as here. This sense of
ἔχειν λόγον, ‘to be reputed’, is more
commonly found with an infinitive:
e.g. Plato <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epin.</cite></span> 987 <span class='fss'>B</span> αὑτὸς Ἀφροδίτης
εἶναι σχέδον ἔχει λόγον. (iv) ‘To

ἔχειν with other constructions, or

‘to bear a ratio’, etc., but do
not come under consideration here.

ἐθελοκωφέιν, ἐθελορήτωρ, ἐθελοπρόξενος:
these compounds being
used most frequently, though not always

<p class='c034'>ἀφειδείᾳ σώματος] ‘<em>hard treatment

τοῦ σώματος is not uncommon, being
used most frequently, not as here of
ascetic discipline, but rather of courageous
exposure to hardship and
danger in war, e.g. Lysias <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Or. Fun.</cite></span>

The καὶ before ἀφειδείᾳ should probably
be omitted; in which case ἀφειδείᾳ
becomes an instrumental dative, explaining
λόγον ἔχοντα σοφίας. While
the insertion would naturally occur to
scribes, the omission gives more point

<p class='c034'>The language, which the Colossian
false teachers would use, may be inferred
from the account given by Philo
of a Judaic sect of mystic ascetics,
who may be regarded, not indeed as
their direct, but as their collateral
ancestors (see p. 86, note <a href='#f246'>246</a>, p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>), the

ἐχθρόν τε καὶ ἐπίβουλον ἐκτρεπόμενοι

has before him some similar
exposition of the views of the Colossian
heretics, either in writing or
(more probably) by report from Epaphras.
In reply he altogether denies
the claims of this system to the title
of σοφία; he disputes the value of
these δόγματα; he allows that this
πλησμονή is the great evil to be checked,
the fatal disease to be cured; but
he will not admit that the remedies
prescribed have any substantial and
lasting efficacy.</p>

<p class='c034'>The interpretation here offered is
not new, but it has been strangely
overlooked or despised. The passages
adduced will I trust show the
groundlessness of objections which
have been brought against it owing to
the use of the preposition; and in all
other respects it seems to be far preferable
to any rival explanation which
has been suggested. The favourite
interpretations in ancient or modern
times divide themselves into two
classes, according to the meaning assigned
to πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός.
(1) It is explained in a good sense:
‘to satisfy the reasonable wants of the
body’. In this case οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινί is
generally interpreted, ‘<em>not</em> holding it
(the body) <em>in any honour</em>’. So the
majority of the fathers, Greek and
Latin. This has the advantage of
preserving the continuity of the words
οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινι πρὸς πλησμονὴν κ.τ.λ.:
but it assigns an impossible sense to
πλησμονὴ τῆς σαρκός. For πλησμονή
always denotes ‘repletion’, ‘surfeiting’,
‘excessive indulgence’, and cannot
be used of a reasonable attention
to the physical cravings of nature; as
Galen says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>XV.</span> p. 113 πάντων εἰωθότων
οὐ μόνον ἰατρῶν ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων
Ἑλλήνων τὸ τῆς πλησμονῆς ὄνομα
μᾶλλόν πως ἐπιφέρειν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ταῖς ὑπερβολαῖς
τῆς συμμέτρου ποσότητος</em>&nbsp;:
and certainly neither the Apostle nor
the Colossian ascetics were likely to
depart from this universal rule. To
the long list of passages quoted in
Wetstein may be added such references
as Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. ad. Cai.</cite></span> § 1 (<span class='fss'>II.</span>
p. 546), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> viii. 15, Justin
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial.</cite></span> 126, Dion. Alex. in Euseb. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>H.E.</cite></span>
vii. 25; but they might be increased
to any extent. (2) A bad sense is
attached to πλησμονή, as usage demands.
And here two divergent interpretations
have been put forward.
(i) The proper continuity of the sentence
is preserved, and the words οὐκ
ἐν τιμῇ τινὶ πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός
are regarded as an exposition of the
doctrine of the false teachers from
<em>their own point of view</em>. So Theodore
of Mopsuestia, οὐ τίμιον νομίζοντας
τὸ διὰ πάντων πληροῦν τὴν σάρκα,
ἀλλὰ γὰρ μᾶλλον αἱρουμένους ἀπέχεσθαι
τῶν πολλῶν διὰ τὴν τοῦ νόμου παράδοσιν.
This able expositor however is
evidently dissatisfied, for he introduces
his explanation with the words
ἀσαφὲς μέν ἐστι, βούλεται δὲ εἰπεῖν
κ.τ.λ.; and his explanation has not
been adopted by others. Either the
sentence, so interpreted, becomes flat
and unmeaning, though it is obviously
intended to clinch the whole matter;
or the Apostle is made to confirm the
value of the very doctrines which he
is combating. (ii) The sentence is
regarded as discontinuous; and it is
interpreted, ‘<em>not of any real value</em>’
(or ‘<em>not</em> consisting <em>in anything commendable</em>’,
or ‘<em>not</em> holding the body
<em>in any honour</em>’) but ‘<em>tending to gratify
the carnal</em> desires’ (or ‘mind’).
This in some form or other is almost
universally adopted by modern interpreters,
and among the ancients is
found in the commentator Hilary.
The objections to it are serious. (α)
The dislocation of the sentence is inexplicable.
There is no indication
either in the grammar or in the vocabulary
that a separate and oppositive
clause begins with πρὸς πλησμονὴν
κ.τ.λ., but on the contrary everything
points to an unbroken continuity. (β)
The sense which it attaches to πλησμονὴ
τῆς σαρκός is either forced and
unnatural, or it makes the Apostle
say what he could not have said. If
πλησμονὴ τῆς σαρκός could have the
sense which Hilary assigns to it, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘sagina
carnalis sensus traditio humana
est’</span>, or indeed if it could mean ‘the
<em>mind</em> of the flesh’ in any sense (as it
is generally taken by modern commentators),
this is what St Paul might
well have said. But obviously πλησμονὴ
τῆς σαρκός conveys a very different
idea from such expressions as τὸ
φυσιοῦσθαι  ὑπὸ  τοῦ  νοὸς τῆς σαρκός
(ver. 18) or τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκός
(Rom. viii. 6, 7), which include pride,
self-sufficiency, strife, hatred, bigotry,
and generally everything that is earth-bound
and selfish. On the other hand,
if πλησμονὴ τῆς σαρκός be taken in its
natural meaning, as applying to coarse
sensual indulgences, then St Paul
could not have said without qualification,
that this rigorous asceticism
conduced πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός.
Such language would defeat its own
object by its extravagance.</p>

<p class='c033'>III. 1–4. ‘If this be so; if ye were
raised with Christ, if ye were translated
into heaven, what follows? Why
you must realise the change. All your
aims must centre in heaven, where
reigns the Christ who has thus exalted
you, enthroned on God’s right
hand. All your thoughts must abide
in heaven, not on the earth. For, I
say it once again, you have nothing to
do with mundane things: you <em>died</em>,
died once for all to the world: you
are living another life. This life indeed
is hidden now: it has no outward
splendour as men count splendour;
for it is a life with Christ, a life
in God. But the veil will not always
shroud it. Christ, our life, shall be
manifested hereafter; then ye also
shall be manifested with Him and the
world shall see your glory’.</p>

<p class='c034'>1. εἰ οὖν συνηγέρθητε κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>If
then ye were raised</em>’, not ‘<em>have been
raised</em>’. The aorist συνηγέρθητε, like
ἀπεθάνετε (ii. 20), refers to their baptism;
and the εἰ οὖν here is a resumption
of the εἰ in ii. 20. The sacrament
of baptism, as administered in
the Apostolic age, involved a twofold
symbolism, a death or burial and
a resurrection: see the note on ii.
12. In the rite itself these were represented
by two distinct acts, the
disappearance beneath the water and
the emergence from the water: but
in the change typified by the rite they
are two aspects of the same thing,
‘like the concave and convex in a circle’,
to use an old simile. The negative
side—the death and burial—implies
the positive side—the resurrection.
Hence the form of the Apostle’s
resumption, εἰ ἀπεθάνετε, εἰ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>οὖν</em>&nbsp;
συνηγέρθητε.</p>

<p class='c034'>The change involved in baptism, if
truly realised, must pervade a man’s
whole nature. It affects not only his
practical conduct, but his intellectual
conceptions also. It is nothing less
than a removal into a new sphere of
being. He is translated from earth
to heaven; and with this translation
his point of view is altered, his standard
of judgment is wholly changed.
Matter is to him no longer the great
enemy; his position towards it is one
of absolute neutrality. Ascetic rules,
ritual ordinances, have ceased to have
any absolute value, irrespective of
their effects. All these things are of
the earth, earthy. The material, the
transitory, the mundane, has given
place to the moral, the eternal, the
heavenly.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὰ ἄνω ζητεῖτε κ.τ.λ.] ‘Cease to
concentrate your energies, your
thoughts, on mundane ordinances, and
realise your new and heavenly life, of
which Christ is the pole-star’.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν δεξιᾷ κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>being seated on the
right hand of God</em>’, where καθήμενος
must not be connected with ἐστιν;
see the note on ἀπόκρυφοι, ii. 3. This
participial clause is pertinent and
emphatic, for the session of Christ
implies the session of the believer
also; Ephes. ii. 4–6 ὁ δὲ Θεός ... ἡμᾶς ...

see also Theoph. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad Autol.</cite></span> ii. 17.
Extremes meet. Here the Apostle
points the antithesis to controvert a
Gnostic asceticism: in the Philippian
letter he uses the same contrast to
denounce an Epicurean sensualism.
Both alike are guilty of the same fundamental
error; both alike concentrate
their thoughts on material, mundane
things.</p>

<p class='c034'>3. ἀπεθάνετε] ‘<em>ye died</em>’ in baptism.
The aorist ἀπεθάνετε denotes the past
act; the perfect κέκρυπται the permanent
effects. For ἀπεθάνετε see the
notes on ii. 12, 20.</p>

<p class='c034'>κέκρυπται] ‘<em>is hidden</em>, is buried
out of sight, to the world’. The Apostle’s
argument is this: ‘When you
sank under the baptismal water, you
disappeared for ever to the world.
You rose again, it is true, but you
rose only to God. The world henceforth
knows nothing of your new life,
and (as a consequence) your new life
must know nothing of the world.’

pronoun would have been more natural,
but less emphatic.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἡ ζωὴ ἡμῶν] This is an advance on
the previous statement, ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν
κέκρυπται σὺν τῷ Χριστῷ, in two respects:
(1) It is not enough to have
said that the life is shared <em>with</em> Christ.
The Apostle declares that the life <em>is</em>
Christ. Comp. 1 Joh. v. 12 ὁ ἔχων τὸν
ὑὶον ἔχει τὴν ζώην, Ign. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ephes.</cite></span> 7 ἐν θανάτῳ

substituted ἡμῶν. The Apostle hastens
to include himself among the recipients
of the bounty. For this characteristic
transition from the second
person to the first see the note on ii.
13. The reading ὑμῶν here has very
high support, and on this account I
have given it as an alternative; but
it is most probably a transcriber’s correction,
for the sake of uniformity
with the preceding.</p>

<p class='c034'>τότε καὶ ὑμεῖς κ.τ.λ.] ‘The veil which

<p class='c033'>5–11. ‘So then realise this death
to the world; kill all your earthly
members. Is it fornication, impurity
of whatever kind, passion, evil desire?
Or again, is it that covetousness which
makes a religion, an idolatry, of greed?
Do not deceive yourselves. For all
these things God’s wrath will surely
come. In these sins ye, like other
Gentiles, indulged in times past, when
your life was spent amidst them. But
now everything is changed. Now you
also must put away not this or that
desire, but all sins whatsoever. Anger,
wrath, malice, slander, filthy
abuse; banish it from your lips. Be
not false one to another in word or
deed; but cast off for ever the old
man with his actions, and put on the
new, who is renewed from day to day,
growing unto perfect knowledge and
refashioned after the image of his
Creator. In this new life, in this
regenerate man, there is not, there
cannot be, any distinction of Greek or
Jew, of circumcision or uncircumcision;
there is no room for barbarian,
for Scythian, for bond or free. Christ
has displaced, has annihilated, all
these; Christ is Himself all things
and in all things’.</p>

<p class='c034'>5. The false doctrine of the Gnostics
had failed to check sensual indulgence
(ii. 23). The true doctrine of
the Apostle has power to kill the
whole carnal man. The substitution
of a comprehensive principle for
special precepts—of the heavenly life
in Christ for a code of minute ordinances—at
length attains the end
after which the Gnostic teachers have
striven, and striven in vain.</p>

<p class='c034'>νεκρώσατε οὖν] i.e. ‘Carry out this
principle of <em>death</em> to the world (ii. 20
ἀπεθάνετε, iii. 3 ἀπεθάνετε), and kill
everything that is mundane and carnal
in your being’.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὰ μέλη κ.τ.λ.] Each person has a
twofold moral personality. There is
in him the ‘old man’, and there is in
him also ‘the new’ (vv. 9, 10). The
old man with all his members must
be pitilessly slain. It is plain that τὰ
μέλη here is used, like ἄνθρωπος in
ver. 9, not physically, but morally.
Our actual limbs may be either τὰ ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς or τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐράνοις, according
as they are made instruments for
the world or for Christ: just as we—our
whole being—may identify ourselves
with the παλαιὸς ἄνθρωπος or
with the νέος ἄνθρωπος of our twofold
potentiality. For this use of the physical,
as a symbol of the moral of
which it is the potential instrument,
compare Matt. v. 29 sq. εἰ δὲ ὁ ὀφθαλμός
σου ὁ δεξιὸς σκανδαλίζει σε, ἔξελε
αὐτὸν κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>I have ventured to punctuate
after τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Thus πορνείαν
κ.τ.λ. are prospective accusatives,
which should be governed directly by
some such word as ἀπόθεσθε. But
several dependent clauses interpose;
the last of these incidentally suggests
a contrast between the past and the
present; and this contrast, predominating
in the Apostle’s mind, leads to
an abrupt recasting of the sentence,
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>νυνὶ δὲ</em>&nbsp; ἀπόθεσθε καὶ ὑμεῖς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τὰ πάντα</em>&nbsp;
in disregard of the original construction.
This opposition of ποτέ and νῦν
has a tendency to dislocate the construction
in St Paul, as in i. 22 νυνὶ δὲ
ἀποκατηλλάγητε (or ἀποκατήλλαξεν), i. 26
νῦν δὲ ἐφανέρωθη: see the note on this
latter passage. For the whole run of
the sentence (the parenthetic relative
clauses, the contrast of past and present,
and the broken construction)
compare Ephes. ii. 1–5 καὶ ὑμᾶς ... ἐν
αἷς ποτέ ... ἐν οἷς καὶ ... ποτε ... ὁ δὲ Θεός ...
καὶ ὄντας ἡμᾶς συνεζωοποίησεν.</p>

<p class='c034'>With the common punctuation the
interpretation is equally awkward,
whether we treat τὰ μέλη and πορνείαν
κ.τ.λ. as in direct apposition, or
as double accusatives, or in any other
way. The case is best put by Severianus,
σάρκα καλεῖ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν, ἧς καὶ
τὰ μέλη καταριθμεῖ ... ὁ παλαιὸς ἄνθρωπός
ἐστιν τὸ φρόνημα τὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας,
μέλη δὲ αὐτοῦ αἱ πράξεις τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων;
but this is an evasion of the
difficulty, which consists in the direct
apposition of the instruments and the
activities, from whatever point they
are viewed.</p>

<p class='c034'>πορνείαν κ.τ.λ.] The general order
is from the less comprehensive to the
more comprehensive. Thus πορνεία is
a special kind of uncleanness, while
ἀκαθαρσία is uncleanness in any form,
Ephes. v. 3 πορνεία δὲ καὶ ἀκαθαρσία
πᾶσα; comp. Gal. v. 19 πορνεία, ἀκαθαρσία,
ἀσέλγεια, with the note there.
Thus again πάθος, though frequently
referring to this class of sins (Rom. i.
26, 1 Thess. iv. 5), would include other
base passions which do not fall under
the category of ἀκαθαρσία, as for instance
gluttony and intemperance.</p>

<p class='c034'>πάθος, ἐπιθυμίαν] The two words
occur together in 1 Thess. iv. 5 μὴ ἐν
πάθει ἐπιθυμίας. So in a passage closely
resembling the text, Gal. v. 24 οἱ δὲ
τοῦ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τὴν σάρκα ἐστάυρωσαν
σὺν τοῖς παθήμασιν καὶ ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις.
The same vice may be viewed
as a πάθος from its passive and an ἐπιθυμία
from its active side. The word
ἐπιθυμία is not used here in the restricted
sense which it has e.g. in
Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eth. Nic.</cite></span> ii. 4, where it ranges
with anger, fear, etc., being related
to πάθος as the species to the genus
(see Gal. l.c. note). In the Greek
Testament ἐπιθυμία has a much more
comprehensive sense; e.g. Joh. viii. 44
τὰς ἐπιθυμίας τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν θέλετε
ποιεῖν. Here, if anything, ἐπιθυμία
is wider than πάθος. While πάθος includes
all ungovernable affections, ἐπιθυμία
κακή reaches to all evil longings.
Ἰδού, says Chrysostom, γενικῶς τὸ πᾶν
εἶπε· πάντα γὰρ ἐπιθυμία κακή, βασκανία,
ὀργή, λύπη. The epithet is added
because ἐπιθυμία is capable of a good
sense: comp. 1 Cor. x. 6 ἐπιθυμητὰς
κακῶν.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ τὴν πλεονεξίαν] ‘<em>and</em> especially
<em>covetousness</em>’. Impurity and covetousness
may be said to divide between
them nearly the whole domain of human
selfishness and vice; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Si avaritia
prostrata est, exsurgit libido’</span> (Cypr.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mort.</cite></span> 3). The one has been already
dealt with; the other needs now to be
specially denounced; comp. Ephes.

Bengel (on Rom. i. 29), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quærit pabulum

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Test. xii Patr.</cite></span> Jud. 18 φυλάξασθε

that πλεονεξία is much wider than
φιλαργυρία (see Trench <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>N. T. Syn.</cite></span>
§ xxiv, p. 77 sq.), which itself is called
ῥίζα πάντων τῶν κακῶν (1 Tim. vi. 10).</p>

<p class='c034'>The attempt to give πλεονεξία here
and in other passages the sense of ‘impurity’
(see e.g. Hammond on Rom.
i. 29) is founded on a misconception.
The words πλεονεκτεῖν, πλεονεξία, will
sometimes be used in relation to sins
of uncleanness, because such may be
acts of injustice also. Thus adultery
is not only impurity, but it is robbery
also: hence 1 Thess. iv. 6 τὸ μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν
καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν ἐν τῷ πράγματι
τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ (see the note
there). In other passages again there
will be an accidental connexion; e.g.
Ephes. iv. 19 εἰς ἐργασίαν ἀκαθαρσίας
πάσης ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ, i.e. ‘with greediness’,
‘with entire disregard for the
rights of others’. But no where do
the words in themselves suggest this
meaning. Here the particles καὶ τὴν
show that a new type of sin is introduced
with πλεονεξίαν: and in the
parallel passage Ephes. v. 3 (quoted
above) the same distinction is indicated
by the change from the conjunctive
particle καί to the disjunctive
ἤ. It is an error to suppose that this
sense of πλεονεξία is supported by
Clem. Alex. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> iii. 12 (p. 551 sq.)
ὡς γὰρ ἡ πλεονεξία πορνεία λέγεται, τῇ
αὐταρκείᾳ ἐναντιουμένη. On the converse
error of explaining ἀκαθαρσία to
mean ‘greediness’, ‘covetousness’, see
the note on 1 Thess. ii. 3.</p>

<cite>Philippians</cite> p. 63 on the misunderstanding
of this passage). The covetous
man sets up another object of
worship besides God. There is a sort
of religious purpose, a devotion of the
soul, to greed, which makes the sin
of the miser so hateful. The idea of
avarice as a <em>religion</em> may have been
suggested to St Paul by our Lord’s
words, Matt. vi. 24 οὐ δύνασθε Θεῷ
δουλεύειν καὶ μαμωνᾷ, though it is a
mistake to suppose that Mammon was
the name of a Syrian deity. It appears
however elsewhere in Jewish
writers of this and later ages: e.g.
Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mon.</cite></span> i. 2 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 214 sq.) πανταχόθεν
μὲν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον ἐκπορίζουσι,

per f&oelig;nus, ille est idololatra’</span> (with
other passages quoted by Wetstein and
Schöttgen on Ephes. v. 5). St Chrysostom,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hom. in Johann. lxv</cite></span> (<span class='fss'>VIII.</span>
p. 392 sq.), enlarges on the cult of
wealth—the consecration of it, the
worship paid to it, the sacrifices demanded
by it: ἡ δὲ φιλαργυρία λέγει,
Θῦσόν μοι τὴν σαυτοῦ ψυχήν, καὶ πείθει·
ὁρᾷς ὅιους ἔχει βωμούς, οἷα δέχεται θύματα
(p. 393). The passage in <cite>Test.
xii Patr.</cite> Jud. 18 ἡ φιλαργυρία πρὸς
ἔιδωλα ὁδηγεῖ is no real parallel to St
Paul’s language, though at first sight
it seems to resemble it. For ἥτις,
‘seeing that it’, see the note on Phil.
iv. 3.</p>

<p class='c034'>6, 7. δι’ ἅ κ.τ.λ.] The received
text requires correction in two points.
(1) It inserts the words ἐπὶ τοὺς ὑιοὺς
τῆς ἀπειθείας after τοῦ Θεοῦ. Though
this insertion has preponderating support,
yet the words are evidently interpolated
from the parallel passage,
Ephes. v. 6 διὰ ταῦτα γὰρ ἐρχεται ἡ
ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὑιοὺς τῆς ἀπειθείας.
We are therefore justified in
rejecting them with other authorities,
few in number but excellent in character.
See the detached note on various
readings. When the sentence is
thus corrected, the parallelism of δι’
ἅ ... εν οἷς καί ... may be compared with
Ephes. i. 11 ἐν hῷ καὶ ἐκληρώθημεν ... ἐν hῷ
καὶ ὑμεῖς ... ἐν hῷ καὶ πιστεύσαντες ἐσφραγίσθητε,
and ii. 21, 22 ἐν hῷ πᾶσα [ἡ]
οἰκοδομὴ ... ἐν ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς συνοικοδομεῖσθε.
(2) The vast preponderance
of authority obliges us to substitute
τούτοις for αὐτοῖς.</p>

<p class='c034'>6. ἐρχεται] This may refer either
to the present and continuous dispensation,
or to the future and final judgment.
The present ἐρχεσθαι is frequently
used to denote the <em>certainty</em>
of a future event, e.g. Matt. xvii. 11,
Joh. iv. 21, xiv. 3, whence ὁ ἐρχόμενος
is a designation of the Messiah: see
Winer § xl. p. 332.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἐν οἷς κ.τ.λ.] The clause ἐπὶ τοὺς
ὑιοὺς τῆς ἀπειθείας having been struck
out, ἐν οἷς must necessarily be neuter
and refer to the same as δι’ ἅ. Independently
of the rejection of the
clause, this neuter seems more probable
in itself than the masculine: for
(1) The expression περιπατεῖν ἐν is
most commonly used of things, not of
persons, especially in this and the
companion epistle; iv. 5, Ephes. ii. 2,
10, iv. 17, v. 2; (2) The Apostle would
hardly denounce it as a sin in his Colossian
converts that they ‘walked
<em>among</em> the sons of disobedience’; for
the Christian, though not of the world,
is necessarily in the world: comp. 1
Cor. v. 10. The apparent parallel,
Ephes. ii. 3 ἐν οἷς καὶ ἡμεῖς πάντες ἀνεστράφημέν
ποτε ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις τῆς
σαρκὸς ἡμῶν (where οἷς seems to be
masculine), does not hold, because the
addition ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις κ.τ.λ. makes
all the difference. Thus the rejection
of the clause, which was decided by
textual considerations, is confirmed by
exegetical reasons.</p>

<p class='c034'>7. καὶ ὑμεῖς] ‘<em>ye</em>, like the other
heathen’ (i. 6 καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν), but in the
next verse καὶ ὑμεῖς is rather ‘ye yourselves’,
‘ye notwithstanding your former
lives’.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὅτε ἐζῆτε κ.τ.λ.] ‘When <em>ye</em> lived in
this atmosphere of sin, when ye had
not yet died to the world’.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν τούτοις] ‘<em>in these things</em>.’ We
should have expected αὐτοῖς, but
τούτοις is substituted as more emphatic
and condemnatory: comp. Ephes.
v. 6 διὰ ταῦτα γὰρ ἐρχεται κ.τ.λ. The
two expressions ζῆν ἐν and περιπατεῖν
ἐν involve two distinct ideas, denoting
the condition of their life and the character
of their practice respectively.
Their conduct was conformable to
their circumstances. Comp. Gal. v. 25
εἰ ζῶμεν πνεύματι, πνεύματι καὶ στοιχῶμεν.</p>

<p class='c034'>8. The errors of the past suggest
the obligations of the present. Thus
the Apostle returns to the topic with
which the sentence commenced. But
the violence of the contrast has broken
up the grammar of the sentence: see
the note on ver. 5.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὰ πάντα] ‘not only those vices which
have been specially named before
(ver. 5), but <em>all</em> of whatever kind.’ The
Apostle accordingly goes on to specify
sins of a wholly different type
from those already mentioned, sins
of uncharitableness, such as anger,
detraction, malice, and the like.</p>

<p class='c033'>ὀργήν, θυμόν] ‘<em>anger</em>, <em>wrath</em>’. The
one denotes a more or less settled
feeling of hatred, the other a tumultuous
outburst of passion. This distinction
of the two words was fixed
chiefly by the definitions of the Stoics:
Diog. Laert. vii. 114 ὁ δὲ θυμός ἐστιν
ὀργὴ ἀρχομένη. So Ammianus θὺμος
μέν ἐστι πρόσκαιρος, ὀργὴ δὲ πολυχρόνιος
μνησικακία, Greg. Naz. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carm.</cite></span> 34
(<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 612) θυμὸς μέν ἐστιν ἀθρόος ζέσις
φρενός, ὀργὴ δὲ θυμὸς ἐμμένων. They
may be represented in Latin by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ira</em></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>furor</em></span>; Senec. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Ira</cite></span> ii. 36 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Ajacem
in mortem egit furor, in furorem
ira’</span>, and Jerome in Ephes. iv. 31 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Furor
incipiens ira est’</span>: see Trench
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>N. T. Syn.</cite></span> § xxxvii, p. 123 sq. On
other synonymes connected with θυμός
and ὀργή see the note on Ephes.
iv. 31.</p>

<p class='c034'>κακίαν] ‘<em>malice</em>’, or ‘<em>malignity</em>’, as
it may be translated in default of a
better word. It is not (at least in the
New Testament) vice generally, but
the vicious nature which is bent on
<em>doing harm to others</em>, and is well defined
by Calvin (on Ephes. iv. 31) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘animi
pravitas, quæ <em>humanitati et æquitati</em>
est opposita’</span>. This will be evident
from the connexion in which it
appears, e.g. Rom. i. 29, Eph. iv. 31,
Tit. iii. 3. Thus κακία and πονηρία
(which frequently occur together, e.g.
1 Cor. v. 8) only differ in so far as the
one denotes rather the vicious disposition,
the other the active exercise of
it. The word is carefully investigated
in Trench <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>N. T. Syn.</cite></span> § xi. p. 35 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>βλασφημίαν] ‘<em>evil speaking</em>, <em>railing</em>,
<em>slandering</em>’, as frequently, e.g.
Rom. iii. 8, xiv. 16, 1 Cor. iv. 13 (v.l.),
x. 30, Ephes. iv. 31, Tit. iii. 2. The
word has the same twofold sense, ‘evil
speaking’ and ‘blasphemy’, in classical
writers, which it has in the New
Testament.</p>

<p class='c034'>αἰσχρολογίαν] ‘<em>foul-mouthed abuse</em>’.
The word, as used elsewhere, has two
meanings: (1) ‘<em>Filthy-talking</em>’, as defined
in Clem. Alex. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pæd.</cite></span> ii. 6 (p.
189 sq.), where it is denounced at
length: comp. Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pol.</cite></span> vii. 17, Epict.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Man.</cite></span> 33, Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> 9, and so commonly;
(2) ‘<em>Abusive language</em>’, as
e.g. Polyb. viii. 13. 8, xii. 13. 3, xxxi.
10. 4. If the two senses of the word
had been quite distinct, we might have
had some difficulty in choosing between
them here. The former sense
is suggested by the parallel passage
Ephes. v. 4 αἰσχρότης καὶ μωρολογία ἤ
εὐτραπελία; the second by the connexion
with βλασφημία here. But
the second sense is derived from the
first. The word can only mean ‘abuse’,
when the abuse is ‘foul-mouthed’.
And thus we may suppose that both
ideas, ‘filthiness’ and ‘evil-speaking’,
are included here.</p>

<p class='c034'>9. ἀπεκδυσάμενοι κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>putting
off</em>’. Do these aorist participles describe
an action coincident with or
prior to the ψεύδεσθε? In other
words are they part of the command,
or do they assign the reason for the
command? Must they be rendered
‘putting off’, or ‘seeing that ye did (at
your baptism) put off’? The former
seems the more probable interpretation:
for (1) Though both ideas are
found in St Paul, the imperative is the
more usual; e.g. Rom. xiii. 12 sq. ἀποθώμεθα
οὖν τὰ ἐργα τοῦ σκότους, ἐνδυσώμεθα
δὲ τὰ ὅπλα τοῦ φωτός ... ἐνδύσασθε
τὸν Κύριον Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, Ephes. vi. 11
ἐνδύσασθε τὴν πανοπλίαν with ver. 14
στῆτε οὖν ... ἐνδυσάμενοι κ.τ.λ., 1 Thess.
V. 8 νήφωμεν ἐνδυσάμενοι κ.τ.λ. The
one exception is Gal. iii. 27 ὅσοι γὰρ
εἰς Χριστὸν ἐβαπτίσθητε, Χριστὸν ἐνεδύσασθε.
(2) The ‘putting on’ in
the parallel passage, Ephes. iv. 24, is
imperative, not affirmative, whether
we read ἐνδύσασθαι or ἐνδύσασθε.
(3) The participles here are followed
immediately by an imperative in the
context, ver. 12 ἐνδύσασθε οὖν, where
the idea seems to be the same. For
the synchronous aorist participle see
Winer § xlv. p. 430. St Paul uses
ἀπεκδυσάμενοι, ἐνδυσάμενοι (not ἀπεκδύομενοι,
ἐνδύομενοι), for the same
reason for which he uses ἐνδύσασθε
(not ἐνδύεσθε), because it is a thing to
be done <em>once for all</em>. For the double
compound ἀπεκδύεσθαι see the notes
on ii. 11, 15.</p>

Of the two words νέος and καινός,
the former refers solely to time,

new as being <em>fresh</em>: the one is opposed
to long duration, the other to
effeteness; see Trench <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>N. T. Syn.</cite></span>

<p class='c034'>The νέος or καινὸς ἄνθρωπος in these

ἐνδύσασθαι. For the opposite
see Ephes. iv. 22 τὸν παλαὶον
ἄνθρωπον τὸν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>φθειρόμενον</em>&nbsp; κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν] ‘<em>unto perfect knowledge</em>’,
the true knowledge in Christ,
as opposed to the false knowledge of
the heretical teachers. For the implied
contrast see above pp. 44, 99 sq.
(see the notes on i. 9, ii. 3), and for
the word ἐπίγνωσις the note on i. 9.
The words here are to be connected
closely with ἀνακαινούμενον: comp.
Heb. vi. 6 πάλιν &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>ἀνακαινίζειν</em>&nbsp; εἰς μετάνοιαν.</p>

<p class='c034'>κατ’ εἰκόνα κ.τ.λ.] The reference is
to Gen. i. 26 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός Ποίησωμεν
ἄνθρωπον κατ’ εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν
κ.τ.λ.; comp. ver. 28 κατ’ εἰκόνα Θεοῦ
ἐποίησεν αὐτόν. See also Ephes. iv. 24

This reference however does
not imply an identity of the creation
here mentioned with the creation of
Genesis, but only an analogy between</p>

<p class='c034'>the two. The spiritual man in each
believer’s heart, like the primal man
in the beginning of the world, was
created after God’s image. The καινὴ
κτίσις in this respect resembles the
ἀρχαία κτίσις. The pronoun αὐτὸν
cannot be referred to anything else
but the νέος ἄνθρωπος, the regenerate
man; and the aorist κτίσαντος
(compare κτισθέντα in the parallel
passage Ephes. iv. 24) refers to the
time of this ἀναγέννησις in Christ.

αὐτοῦ ἡμᾶς, after which Gen. i. 26
is quoted. The new birth was a recreation
in God’s image; the subsequent
life must be a deepening of this
image thus stamped upon the man.</p>

<p class='c034'>The allusion to Genesis therefore
requires us to understand τοῦ κτίσαντος
of God, and not of Christ, as it is
taken by St Chrysostom and others;
and this seems to be demanded also
by the common use of ὁ κτίσας. But
if Christ is not ὁ κτίσας, may He not be
intended by the εἰκῶν τοῦ κτίσαντος?
In favour of this interpretation it may
be urged (1) That Christ elsewhere is
called the εἰκὼν of God, i. 15, 2 Cor.
iv. 4; (2) That the Alexandrian school
interpreted the term in Gen. i. 26 as
denoting the Logos; thus Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Mund.</cite></span> Op. 6 (<span class='fss'>I</span>. p. 5 <span class='fss'>M</span>) τὸ ἀρχέτυπον
παράδειγμα, ἰδέα τῶν ἰδεῶν ὁ Θεοῦ λόγος
(comp. ib. §§ 7, 23, 24, 48), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fragm.</cite></span>
II. p. 625 <span class='fss'>M</span> θνητὸν γὰρ οὐδὲν ἀπεικονισθῆναι
πρὸς τὸν ἀνωτάτω καὶ πατέρα

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. Alleg.</cite></span> i. 31, 32 (<span class='fss'>I</span>. p. 106 sq.).
Hence Philo speaks of the first man
as εἰκὼν εἰκόνος (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Mund. Op.</cite></span> 6), and
as παγκάλου παραδέιγματος πάγκαλον
μίμημα (ib. § 48). A pregnant meaning
is thus given to κατὰ, and κατ’ εἰκόνα
is rendered ‘after the fashion (or
pattern) of the Image’. But this interpretation
seems very improbable in
St Paul; for (1) In the parallel passage
Ephes. iv. 24 the expression is
simply κατὰ Θεόν, which may be regarded
as equivalent to κατ’ εἰκόνα τοῦ
κτίσαντος here; (2) The Alexandrian
explanation of Gen. i. 26 just quoted
is very closely allied to the Platonic
doctrine of ideas (for the εἰκών, so interpreted,
is the archetype or ideal
pattern of the sensible world), and
thus it lies outside the range of those
conceptions which specially recommended
the Alexandrian terminology
of the Logos to the Apostles, as a fit
vehicle for communicating the truths
of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c033'>οὐκ ἕνι] ‘Not only does the distinction
not exist, but it <em>cannot</em> exist.’
It is a mundane distinction, and therefore
it has disappeared. For the
sense of ἕνι, negativing not merely the
fact but the possibility, see the note
on Gal. iii. 28.</p>

<p class='c034'>Ἕλλην κ.τ.λ.] Comparing the enumeration
here with the parallel passage
Gal. iii. 28, we mark this difference.
In Galatians the abolition of all distinctions
is stated in the broadest
way by the selection of three typical
instances; religious prerogative (Ἰουδαῖος,
Ἕλλην), social caste (δοῦλος, ἐλεύθερος),
natural sex (ἄρσεν, θῆλυ). Here
on the other hand the examples are
chosen with special reference to the
immediate circumstances of the Colossian
Church. (1) The Judaism of
the Colossian heretics is met by Ἕλλην
καὶ Ἰουδαῖος, and as it manifested itself
especially in enforcing circumcision,
this is further emphasized by
περιτομὴ καὶ ἀκροβυστία (see above,
p. 73). (2) Their Gnosticism again is
met by βάρβαρος, Σκύθης. They laid
special stress on intelligence, penetration,
gnosis. The Apostle offers the
full privileges of the Gospel to barbarians
and even barbarians of the lowest
type (see p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a> sq.). In Rom. i. 14,
the division Ἕλλησίν τε καὶ βαρβαροῖς
is almost synonymous with σοφοῖς
τε καὶ ἀνόητοις. (3) Special circumstances,
connected with an eminent
member of the Church of Colossæ,
had directed his attention at this
moment to the relation of masters and
slaves. Hence he cannot leave the
subject without adding δοῦλος, ἐλεύθερος,
though this has no special bearing
on the Colossian heresy. See above
p. 33, and the note on iii. 22, together
with the introduction to the Epistle
to Philemon.</p>

<p class='c034'>περιτομὴ κ.τ.λ.] Enforcing and extending
the lesson of the previous
clause. This abolition of distinctions
applies to religious privilege, not only
as inherited by birth (Ἕλλην καὶ Ἰουδαῖος),
but also as assumed by adoption
(περιτομὴ καὶ ἀκροβυστία). If it is
no advantage to be born a Jew, it is
none to become as a Jew; comp. 1 Cor.
vii. 19, Gal. v. 6, vi. 15.</p>

<a href='#Page_284'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>βάρβαρος] To the Jew the whole
world was divided into Ἰουδαῖοι and
Ἕλληνες, the privileged and unprivileged
portions of mankind, religious
prerogative being taken as the line of
demarcation (see notes Gal. ii. 3).
To the Greek and Roman it was
similarly divided into Ἕλληνες and
βάρβαροι, again the privileged and
unprivileged portion of the human
race, civilization and culture being
now the criterion of distinction.
Thus from the one point of view the
Ἕλλην is contrasted disadvantageously
with the Ἰουδαῖος, while from
the other he is contrasted advantageously
with the βάρβαρος. Both distinctions
are equally antagonistic to
the Spirit of the Gospel. The Apostle
declares both alike null and void in
Christ. The twofold character of the
Colossian heresy enables him to strike
at these two opposite forms of error
with one blow.</p>

<p class='c034'>The word βάρβαρος properly denoted
one who spoke an inarticulate,
stammering, unintelligible language;

of Language</cite></span> 1st ser. p. 81 sq.,

it was adopted by Greek exclusiveness

speaks of τὸ ἥμισυ τμῆμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπων

to τὸ Ἑλληνικόν. It is not necessary
to suppose that they adopted it from
the Egyptians, who seem to have called
non-Egyptian peoples <em>berber</em> (see
Sir G. Wilkinson in Rawlinson’s Herod.
ii. 158); for the onomatop&oelig;ia will
explain its origin independently, Strabo

adopting the Greek culture, adopted
the Greek distinction also, e.g. Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Fin.</cite></span> ii. 15 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Non solum Græcia et Italia,
sed etiam omnis barbaria’</span>: and
accordingly Dionysius, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ant. Rom.</cite></span> i. 69,
classes the Romans with the Greeks
as distinguished from the ‘barbarians’—this
twofold division of the human
race being taken for granted as absolute
and final. So too in v. 8, having
mentioned the Romans, he goes on to
speak of οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες. The older
Roman poets however, writing from a
Greek point of view, (more than half
in irony) speak of themselves as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>barbari</em></span>
and of their country as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>barbaria</em></span>;
e.g. Plaut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mil. Glor.</cite></span> ii. 2. 58 ‘poeta

<p class='c034'>In this classification the Jews necessarily

<p class='c034'>‘Not till that word <em>barbarian</em>’,
writes Prof. Max Müller (l.c. p. 118),
‘was struck out of the dictionary of
mankind and replaced by <em>brother</em>, not
till the right of all nations of the world
to be classed as members of one genus
or kind was recognised, can we look
even for the first beginnings of our
science. This change was effected by
Christianity.... <em>Humanity</em> is a word
which you look for in vain in Plato or
Aristotle; the idea of mankind as one
family, as the children of one God, is
an idea of Christian growth: and the
science of mankind, and of the languages
of mankind, is a science which,
without Christianity, would never have
sprung into life. When people had
been taught to look upon all men as
brethren, then and then only, did the
variety of human speech present itself
as a problem that called for a solution
in the eyes of thoughtful observers:
and I therefore date the real beginning
of the science of language from
the first day of Pentecost.... The common
origin of mankind, the differences
of race and language, the susceptibility
of all nations of the highest mental
culture, these become, in the new
world in which we live, problems of
scientific, because of more than scientific
interest’. St Paul was the great
exponent of the fundamental principle
in the Christian Church which was
symbolized on the day of Pentecost,
when he declared, as here, that in
Christ there is neither Ἕλλην nor
βάρβαρος, or as in Rom. i. 14 that he
himself was a debtor equally Ἕλλησίν
τε καὶ βαρβάροις.</p>

<p class='c034'>The only other passage in the New
Testament (besides those quoted) in
which βάρβαρος occurs is Acts xxviii.
2, 4, where it is used of the people of
Melita. If this Melita be Malta, they
would be of Ph&oelig;nician descent.</p>

<p class='c034'>Σκύθης] the lowest type of barbarian.
There is the same collocation
of words in Dionys. Halic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rhet.</cite></span> xi.

The savageness of the Scythians was
proverbial. The earlier Greek writers
indeed, to whom <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>omne ignotum</em></span> was
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pro magnifico</em></span>, had frequently spoken
of them otherwise (see Strabo vii. 3.
7 sq., p. 300 sq.). Æschylus for instance
called them ἔυνομοι Σκύθαι, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fragm.</cite></span>
189 (comp. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eum.</cite></span> 703). Like the
other Hyperboreans, they were a
simple, righteous people, living beyond
the vices and the miseries
of civilisation. But the common
estimate was far different, and probably
far more true: e.g. 3 Macc.
vii. 5 νόμου Σκυθῶν ἀγριωτέραν ... ὠμότητα
(comp. 2 Macc. iv. 47), Joseph.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Ap.</cite></span> ii. 37 Σκύθαι ... βραχὺ τῶν θηρίων

Philo seems to place the Egyptians
and the Scythians at the two extremes
in the scale of barbarian nations. The
passages given in Wetstein from classical
writers are hardly less strong in
the same direction. Anacharsis the
Scythian is said to have retorted ἑμοὶ
δὲ πάντες Ἕλληνες σκυθίζουσιν, Clem.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> i. 16 (p. 364).</p>

<p class='c034'>The Jews had a special reason for
their unfavourable estimate of the
Scythians. In the reign of Josiah
hordes of these northern barbarians
had deluged Palestine and a great
part of Western Asia (Herod. i. 103–106).
The incident indeed is passed
over in silence in the historical books;
but the terror inspired by these invaders
has found expression in the
prophets (Ezek. xxxviii, xxxix, Jer. i.
13 sq., vi. 1 sq.), and they left behind
them a memorial in the Greek name
of Beth-shean, Σκυθῶν πόλις (Judith iii.
10, 2 Macc. xii. 29: comp. Judges i.
27 <span class='fss'>LXX</span>) or Σκυθόπολις, which seems to
have been derived from a settlement
on this occasion (Plin. <cite>N.H.</cite>  v. 16;
see Ewald. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 689 sq., Grove

<p class='c034'>Hence Justin, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial.</cite></span> § 28 (p. 246 <span class='fss'>A</span>),
describing the largeness of the new
dispensation, says κἂν Σκύθης ᾖ τις ἢ Πέρσης, ἔχει δὲ τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ γνῶσιν
καὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ φυλάσσει

where he singles out two different but
equally low types of barbarians, the
Scythians being notorious for their
ferocity, the Persians for their licentiousness

<p class='c034'>ὡς ἐκλεκτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ] ‘<em>as elect ones
of God.</em>’ Comp. Rom. viii. 33, Tit. i. 1.
In the Gospels κλητοί and ἐκλεκτοί are
distinguished as an outer and an inner
circle (Matt. xxii. 14 πολλοὶ γάρ
εἰσιν κλητοί, ὀλίγοι δὲ ἐκλεκτοί), κλητοί
being those summoned to the privileges
of the Gospel and ἐκλεκτοί those
appointed to final salvation (Matt.
xxiv. 22, 24, 31, Mark xiii. 20, 22, 27,
Luke xviii. 7). But in St Paul no
such distinction can be traced. With
him the two terms seem to be coextensive,
as two aspects of the same process,
κλητοί having special reference to
the goal and ἐκλεκτοί to the starting-point.
The same persons are ‘called’
to Christ, and ‘chosen out’ from the
world. Thus in 1 Thess. i. 4 εἰδότες
τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν κ.τ.λ. the word clearly
denotes election to Church-membership.
Thus also in 2 Tim. ii. 10, where
St Paul says that he endures all things
διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς, adding ἵνα καὶ αὐτὸι
σωτηρίας τύχωσιν κ.τ.λ., the uncertainty
implied in these last words clearly
shows that election to final salvation
is not meant.    In the same sense he
speaks of an individual Christian as
‘elect’, Rom. xvi. 13. And again in
1 Cor. i. 26, 27 βλέπετε τὴν κλῆσιν
ὑμῶν ... τὰ μῶρα τοῦ κόσμου ἐξελέξατο,
the words appear as synonymes. The
same is also the usage of St Peter.
Thus in an opening salutation he addresses
whole Christian communities
as ἐκλεκτοί (1 Pet. i. 1; comp. v. 13 ἡ
συνεκλεκτὴ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, i.e. probably
ἐκκλησία), as St Paul under similar
circumstances (Rom. i. 6, 7, 1 Cor.
i. 2) designates them κλητοί; and in
another passage (2 Pet. i. 10) he appeals
to his readers to make their
κλῆσις and ἐκλογή sure. The use of
ἐκλεκτός in 2 Joh. 1. 13 is apparently
the same; and in Apoc. xvii. 14 οἱ
μετ’ αὐτοῦ κλητοὶ καὶ ἐκλεκτοὶ καὶ πιστοί
this is also the case, as we may
infer from the addition of πιστοί, which
points to those who have been <em>true</em> to
their ‘calling and election’. Thus the
Gospels stand alone in this respect.
In fact ἐκλογή denotes election by
God not only to final salvation, but to
<em>any</em> special privilege or work, whether
it be (1) Church-membership, as
in the passages cited from the epistles;
or (2) The work of preaching, as when
St Paul (Acts ix. 15) is called σκεῦος
ἐκλογῆς, the object of the ‘election’
being defined in the words following,
τοῦ βαστάσαι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐνώπιον
[τῶν] ἐθνῶν τε καὶ βασιλέων κ.τ.λ.; or
(3) The Messiahship, 1 Pet. ii. 4, 6; or
(4) The fatherhood of the chosen
people, as in the case of Isaac and Jacob,
Rom. ix. 11; or (5) The faithful
remnant under the theocracy, Rom.
xi. 5, 7, 28. This last application presents
the closest analogy to the idea
of final salvation: but even here St
Paul treats κλῆσις and ἐκλογή as coextensive,
Rom. xi. 28, 29 κατὰ δὲ τὴν
ἐκλογὴν ἀγαπητοὶ διὰ τοὺς πατέρας·
ἀμεταμέλητα γὰρ τὰ χαρίσματα καὶ ἡ
κλῆσις τοῦ Θεοῦ.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἅγιοι κ.τ.λ.] These are not to be
taken as vocatives, but as predicates
further defining the meaning of ἐκλεκτοί.
All the three terms ἐκλεκτοί,
ἅγιοι, ἠγαπημένοι, are transferred
from the Old Covenant to the New,
from the Israel after the flesh to the
Israel after the Spirit. For the two
former comp. 1 Pet. ii. 9 γένος ἐκλεκτόν
... ἔθνος ἅγιον; and for the sense of
ἅγιοι, ‘the consecrated people of God’,
see the note on Phil. i. 1. For the
third word, ἠγαπημένοι, see Is. v. 1
Ἄσω δὴ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ κ.τ.λ., Hos.
ii. 25 τὴν οὐκ ἠγαπημένην ἠγαπημένην
(as quoted in Rom. ix. 25). In the
New Testament it seems to be used
always of the objects of <em>God’s</em> love:
e.g. 1 Thess. i. 4 εἰδοτές, ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπημένοι
ὑπὸ Θεοῦ, τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν,
2 Thess. ii. 13 ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ
Κυρίου (comp. Jude 1); and so probably
Rev. xx. 9 τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἠγαπημένην.
For the connexion of God’s election
and God’s love see Rom. xi. 28
(quoted above), 1 Thess. <em>l.c.</em> The καὶ
is omitted in one or two excellent
copies (though it has the great preponderance
of authorities in its favour),
and it is impossible not to feel
how much the sentence gains in force
by the omission, ἐκλεκτοὶ Θεοῦ, ἅγιοι,
)ηγαπημένοι; comp. 1 Pet. ii. 6.</p>

<p class='c034'>σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ] ‘<em>a heart of

<p class='c033'>χρηστότητα κ.τ.λ.] The two words
χρηστότης and ταπεινοφροσύνη, ‘kindliness’
and ‘humility’, describe the
Christian <em>temper of mind</em> generally,
and this in two aspects, as it affects
either (1) our relation to others (χρηστότης),
or (2) our estimate of self (ταπεινοφροσύνη).
For χρηστότης see the
note on Gal. v. 22; for ταπεινοφροσύνη,
the note on Phil. ii. 3.</p>

<p class='c034'>πρά"υτητα κ.τ.λ.] These next two
words, πρά"υτης and μακροθυμία, denote
the <em>exercise</em> of the Christian
temper in its outward bearing towards
others. They are best distinguished
by their opposites. πρά"υτης
is opposed to ‘rudeness, harshness’,
ἀγρίοτης (Plato <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Symp.</cite></span> 197 <span class='fss'>D</span>), χαλεπότης
(Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>H. A.</cite></span> ix. i); μακροθυμία to
‘resentment, revenge, wrath,’ ὀργή
(Prov. xvi. 32), ὀξυχολία (Herm. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mand.</cite></span>
v. 1, 2). For the meaning of μακροθυμία

The reciprocal ἑαυτῶν differs from the
reciprocal ἀλλήλων in emphasizing the
idea of <em>corporate unity</em>: hence it is
more appropriate here (comp. Ephes.

<p class='c033'>μομφήν] ‘<em>a complaint</em>’. As μέμφεσθαι
is ‘to find <em>fault</em> with’, referring
most commonly to errors of omission,
so μομφή here is regarded as a <em>debt</em>,
which needs to be remitted. The
rendering of the A. V. ‘a quarrel’
(= querela) is only wrong as being an
archaism. The phrase μομφὴν ἔχειν
occurs several times in classical Greek,
but generally in poetry: e.g. Eur.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Orest.</cite></span> 1069, Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pax</cite></span> 664.</p>

<p class='c034'>καθὼς καὶ κ.τ.λ.] This must not be
connected with the preceding words,
but treated as an independent sentence,
the καθὼς καί being answered
by the οὕτως καί. For the presence of
καί in both clauses of the comparison
see the note on i. 6. The phenomenon
is common in the best classical writers,

<p class='c034'>ὁ Κύριος] This reading, which is
better supported than ὁ Χριστός, is
also more expressive. It recalls more
directly the lesson of the parable
which enforces the duty of fellow-servant
to fellow-servant; Matt. xviii.
27 σπλαγχνισθὲις δὲ ὁ κύριος τοῦ

δάνειον ἀφῆκεν αὐτῷ κ.τ.λ.: comp. below
iv. 1 εἰδότες ὅτι καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔχετε κύριον
ἐν οὐρανῷ. The reading Χριστὸς perhaps
comes from the parallel passage Ephes.

ἐν πίστει ὅ ἐστιν σὰρξ τοῦ Κυρίου.
Though there are various readings in
the passages of the Ignatian Epistles,
the ὅ seems to be right in every case.
These instances will show that ὅ may
be referred to τὴν ἀγάπην alone. Otherwise
we might suppose the antecedent
to be τὸ ἐνδυσασθαι τὴν ἀγάπην,
but this hardly suits the sense. The
common reading ἥτις is obviously a
scribe’s correction.</p>

<p class='c034'>σύνδεσμος κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>the bond of perfection</em>’,
i.e. the power, which unites
and holds together all those graces
and virtues, which together make up
perfection. Πάντα ἐκεῖνα, says Chrysostom,
hάυτη συσφίγγει· ὅπερ ἂν εἴπῃς
ἀγαθόν, τάυτης ἀπούσης οὐδέν ἐστιν
ἀλλὰ διαρρεῖ: comp. Clem. Rom. 49
τὸν δεσμὸν τῆς ἀγαπῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ τίς
δύναται ἐξηγήσασθαι; Thus the Pythagoreans
(Simplic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>in Epictet.</cite></span> p. 208 <span class='fss'>A</span>)
περισσῶς τῶν ἄλλων ἀρετῶν τὴν φιλίαν
ἐτίμων καὶ σύνδεσμον αὐτὴν πασῶν τῶν
ἀρετῶν ἔλεγον. So too Themist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Orat.</cite></span>
i. (p. 5 <span class='fss'>C</span>) βασιλικὴ (ἀρετὴ) παρὰ τὰς
ἄλλας εἰς ἣν ξυνδοῦνται καὶ αἱ λοιπαί,
ὥσπερ εἰς μίαν κορυφὴν ἀνημμέναι.
The word will take a genitive either
of the object bound or of the binding
force: e.g. Plato <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Polit.</cite></span> 310 <span class='fss'>A</span> τοῦτον
θειότερον εἶναι τὸν ξύνδεσμον ἀρετῆς
μερῶν φύσεως ἀνόμοιων καὶ ἐπὶ τἀναντία
φερομένων, where the ἀρετὴ ξυνδεῖ and
the μέρη φύσεως ξυνδεῖται. We have
an instance of the one genitive (the
objective) here, of the other (the subjective)
in Ephes. iv. 3 ἐν τῷ συνδέσμῳ
τῆς εἰρήνης (see the note there).</p>

<p class='c034'>Another explanation makes σύνδεσμος
= σύνθεσις here, ‘the bundle, the
totality’, as e.g. Herodian. iv. 12 πάντα
τὸν σύνδεσμον τῶν ἐπιστολῶν (comp.
Ign. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Trall.</cite></span> 3 σύνδεσμον ἀποστόλων);
but this unusual metaphor is highly
improbable and inappropriate here,
not to mention that we should expect
the definite article ὁ σύνδεσμος in this
case. With either interpretation,
the function assigned to ἀγάπη here
is the same as when it is declared to
be πλήρωμα νόμου, Rom. xiii. 10 (comp.
Gal. v. 14). See also the all-embracing
office which is assigned to it in 1 Cor.
xiii.</p>

<p class='c034'>15. ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Χριστοῦ] ‘<em>Christ’s
peace</em>’, which He left as a legacy to His
disciples: Joh. xiv. 27 εἰρήνην ἀφίημι
ὑμῖν, εἰρήνην &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τὴν ἐμὴν</em>&nbsp; δίδωμι ὑμῖν;
comp. Ephes. ii. 14 αὐτὸς γάρ ἐστιν ἡ
εἰρήνη ἡμῶν with the context. The
common reading ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Θεοῦ has
a parallel in Phil. iv. 7.</p>

<p class='c034'>βραβεύετω] ‘<em>be umpire</em>’, for the
idea of a contest is only less prominent
here, than in βραβεῖον 1 Cor. ix.
24, Phil. iii. 14 (see the note there).
Στάδιον ἕνδον ἐποίησεν ἐν τοῖς λογισμοῖς,
writes Chrysostom, καὶ ἀγῶνα καὶ ἄθλησιν
καὶ βραβευτήν. Wherever there
is a conflict of motives or impulses or
reasons, the peace of Christ must step
in and decide which is to prevail; Μὴ
θυμὸς βραβεύετω, says Chrysostom
again, μὴ φιλονεικία, μὴ ἀνθρωπίνη
εἰρήνη· ἡ γὰρ ἀνθρωπίνη εἰρήνη ἐκ τοῦ
ἀμύνεσθαι γίνεται, ἐκ τοῦ μηδὲν πάσχειν
δεινόν.</p>

<p class='c034'>For this metaphor of some one
paramount consideration acting as
umpire, where there is a conflict of
internal motives, see Polyb. ii. 35. 3
ἅπαν τὸ γιγνόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν Γαλάτων

B. J. vi. 2. 6 ἐβράβευε τὰς τόλμας ὁ ...
φόβος. Somewhat similarly τύχη
(Polyb. xxvii. 14. 4) or φύσις (Athen.
xv. p. 670 <span class='fss'>A</span>) are made βραβεύειν. In
other passages, where ὁ Θεὸς or τὸ
θεῖον is said βραβεύειν, this implies
that, while man proposes, God <em>disposes</em>.
In Philo ἀλήθεια βραβεύουσα
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Qui rer. div. her.</cite></span> 19, I. p. 486) is a
rough synonyme for ἀλήθεια δικάζουσα
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Abrah.</cite></span> 14, II. p. 10, etc.): and
in Josephus (<cite>Ant.</cite> vi. 3. 1) δικάζειν and
βραβεύειν are used together of the
same action. In all such cases it appears
that the idea of a <em>decision</em> and
an <em>award</em> is prominent in the word,
and that it must not be taken to denote
simply <em>rule</em> or <em>power</em>.</p>

is not uncommon in classical writers,
and like the English ‘grateful’, has
two meanings; either (1) ‘pleasurable’
(e.g. Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Cyr.</cite></span> ii. 2. 1); or (2) ‘thankful’

ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ is found
here only. There seems to be no direct
reference in this expression to
any definite body of truths either
written or oral, but ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ
denotes the presence of Christ in

<p class='c034'>ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ] ‘<em>in every kind of

words with the preceding clause,
though Clem. Alex. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pæd.</cite></span> ii. 4 (p. 194)
attaches them to what follows. For
this position of ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ, at the

comp. i. 9, Ephes. i. 8. The connexion
here adopted is also favoured by the

28 νουθετοῦντες πάντα ἄνθρωπον καὶ

σοφίᾳ has a double bearing: while the

<p class='c034'>διδάσκοντες κ.τ.λ.] The participles
are here used for imperatives, as frequently
in hortatory passages, e.g.
Rom. xii. 9 sq., 16 sq., Ephes. iv. 2, 3,
Hebr. xiii. 5, 1 Pet. ii. 12[?], iii. 1, 7, 9,
15, 16. It is not, as some insist, that
the participle itself has any imperatival
force; nor, as maintained by others,
that the construction should be explained
by the hypothesis of a preceding
parenthesis or of a verb substantive
understood or by any other
expedient to obtain a regular grammatical
structure (see Winer, § xlv.
p. 441 sq., § lxii. p. 707, § lxiii. p. 716,
§ lxiv. p. 732). But the absolute participle,
being (so far as regards mood)
neutral in itself, takes its colour from
the general complexion of the sentence.
Thus it is sometimes indicative
(e.g. 2 Cor. vii. 5, and frequently),
sometimes imperative (as in the passages
quoted), sometimes optative (as
above, ii. 2, 2 Cor. ix. 11, comp. Ephes.
iii. 17). On the distinction of διδάσκειν
and νουθετεῖν see the note on i.
28; they describe respectively the positive
and the negative side of instruction.
On the reciprocal ἑαυτούς see
the note on iii. 13.</p>

ἡμῖν ἀγαθοῖς ἀνατιθεμένη τῷ Θεῷ εὐφημία;
see also Hippol. p. 191 sq. (ed.
de Lagarde). In other words, while
the leading idea of ψαλμός is a musical
accompaniment and that of ὕμνος
praise to God, ᾠδή is the general word
for a song, whether accompanied or
unaccompanied, whether of praise or
on any other subject. Thus it was
quite possible for the same song to
be at once ψαλμός, ὕμνος, and ᾠδή.
In the text the reference in ψαλμοῖς,
we may suppose, is specially, though
not exclusively (1 Cor. xiv. 26), to
the Psalms of David, which would
early form part of the religious worship
of the Christian brotherhood.
On the other hand ὕμνοις would more
appropriately designate those hymns
of praise which were composed by the
Christians themselves on distinctly
Christian themes, being either set
forms of words or spontaneous effusions
of the moment. The third word
ᾠδαῖς gathers up the other two, and
extends the precept to all forms of
song, with the limitation however that
they must be πνευματικαί. St Chrysostom
treats ὕμνοι here as an advance
upon ψαλμοί, which in one aspect they
are; οἱ ψαλμοί, he says, πάντα ἔχουσιν,
ὁι δὲ ὕμνοι πάλιν οὐδὲν ἀνθρώπινον·

For instances of singing hymns or
psalms in the Apostolic age see Acts
iv. 24, xvi. 25, 1 Cor. xiv. 15, 26.
Hence even in St Paul’s epistles, more
especially his later epistles, fragments
of such hymns appear to be quoted; e.g.
Ephes. v. 14 (see the note there). For
the use of hymnody in the early Church

<p class='c034'>ἐν τῇ χάριτι] ‘<em>in</em> God’s <em>grace</em>’;
comp. 2 Cor. i. 12 οὐκ ἐν σοφία σαρκικῇ
ἀλλ’ ἐν χάριτι Θεοῦ. These
words are perhaps best connected with
the preceding clause, as by Chrysostom.
Thus the parallelism with ἐν
πάσῃ σοφίᾳ is preserved. The correct
reading is ἐν τῇ χάριτι, not ἐν
χάριτι. For ἡ χάρις, ‘divine grace’,
see Phil. i. 7 συγκοινωνούς μου τῆς
χάριτος with the note. The definite
article seems to exclude all lower
senses of χάρις here, such as ‘acceptableness’,
‘sweetness’ (see iv. 6). The
interpretation ‘with gratitude’, if
otherwise tenable (comp. 1 Cor. x. 30),
seems inappropriate here, because the
idea of thanksgiving is introduced in
the following verse.</p>

<p class='c033'>ἄδοντες κ.τ.λ.] This external manifestation
must be accompanied by the
inward emotion. There must be the
thanksgiving of the heart, as well as
of the lips; comp. Ephes. v. 19 ἄδοντες
καὶ ψάλλοντες τῇ καρδίᾳ (probably the
correct reading), where τῇ καρδίᾳ
‘<em>with</em> the heart’ brings out the sense
more distinctly.</p>

<p class='c034'>17. πᾶν ὅ τι κ.τ.λ.] This is probably
a nominative absolute, as Matt. x.
32 πᾶς οὖν ὅστις ὁμολογήσει ... ὁμολογήσω
κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ (comp. Luke
xii. 8), Luke xii. 10 πᾶς ὃς ἐρεῖ λόγον

comp. Matt. vii. 24 (v.l.).</p>

<p class='c034'>πάντα] sc. ποιεῖτε, as the following
εὐχαριστοῦντες suggests; comp. ver.
23.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν ὀνόματι κ.τ.λ.] This is the great
practical lesson which flows from the
theological teaching of the epistle.
Hence the reiteration of Κυρίῳ, ἐν
Κυρίῳ, etc., vv. 18, 20, 22, 23, 24. See
above p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>.</p>

<p class='c034'>εὐχαριστοῦντες] On this refrain see
the notes on <a href='#I_12'>i. 12</a>, <a href='#II_7'>ii. 7</a>.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῷ Θεῷ πατρὶ] This, which is quite
the best authenticated reading, gives
a very unusual, if not unique, collocation
of words, the usual form being
either ὁ Θεὸς καὶ πατήρ or Θεὸς πατήρ.
The καί before πατρί in the received
text is an obvious emendation. See
the note on i. 3, and the appendix on
various readings.</p>

<p class='c034'>18–21. ‘Ye wives, be subject to
your husbands, for so it becomes you
in Christ. Ye husbands, love and
cherish your wives, and use no harshness
towards them. Ye children, be
obedient to your parents in all things;
for this is commendable and lovely in
Christ. Ye parents, vex not your
children, lest they lose heart and grow
sullen’.</p>

<p class='c034'>18 sq. These precepts, providing
for the conduct of Christians in private
households, should be compared with
Ephes. v. 22–vi. 9, 1 Pet. ii. 18–iii. 7,
Tit. ii. 1 sq.; see also Clem. Rom. 1,
Polyc. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phil.</cite></span> 4 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>Αἱ γυναῖκες] ‘<em>Ye wives</em>’, the nominative
with the definite article being
used for a vocative, as frequently in
the New Testament, e.g. Matt. xi. 26,
Mark v. 41, Luke viii. 54; see Winer
§ xxix. p. 227 sq. The frequency of
this use is doubtless due to the fact
that it is a reproduction of the Hebrew
idiom. In the instances quoted
from classical writers (see Bernhardy
<cite>Syntax</cite> p. 67) the address is
not so directly vocative, the nominative
being used rather to <em>define</em> or <em>select</em>
than to <em>summon</em> the person in question.</p>

<p class='c034'>τοῖς ἀνδράσιν] The ἰδίοις of the
received text may have been inserted
(as it is inserted also in Ephes. v. 24)
from Ephes. v. 22, Tit. ii. 5, 1 Pet. iii.
1, 5, in all which passages this same
injunction occurs. The scribes however
show a general fondness for this
adjective; e.g. Mark xv. 20, Luke ii. 3,

comp. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> Contest. 3 τοῦδε
μὴ μεταδοῦναι χάριν, ὡς οὐ προσῆκεν,
Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Re Equestr.</cite></span> xii. 14 ἃ ἱππάρχῳ
προσῆκεν εἰδέναι τε καὶ πράττειν; and
see D’Orville on Charito viii. 2 (p. 699
sq.). The common uses of the imperfect
ἔδει, ἔπρεπεν, etc., in classical writers
do not present a very exact
parallel; for they imply that the thing
which ought to have been done has
been left undone. And so we might
interpret Acts xxii. 22 οὐ γὰρ καθῆκεν
αὐτὸν ζῆν (the correct reading).
Here however there can hardly be
any such reference; and the best
illustration is the English past tense
‘ought’ (= ‘owed’), which is used in
the same way. The past tense perhaps
implies an essential <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>à priori</em></span>
obligation. The use of χρῆν, ἔχρην,
occasionally approximates to this; e.g.
Eur. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Andr.</cite></span> 423.</p>

<p class='c034'>The idea of ‘propriety’ is the link
which connects the primary meaning
of such words as ἀνήκειν, προσήκειν,
καθήκειν, ‘aiming at or pertaining to’,
with their ultimate meaning of moral
obligation. The word ἀνήκειν occurs
in the New Testament only here and
in the contemporary epistles, Ephes.
v. 4, Philem. 8.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν Κυρίῳ] probably to be connected
with ὡς ἀνῆκεν, rather than with ὑποτάσσεσθε;
comp. ver. 20 εὐάρεστόν
ἐστιν ἐν Κυρίῳ.</p>

<p class='c034'>19. μὴ πικραίνεσθε κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>show no
bitterness, behave not harshly</em>’; comp.

and its compounds occur frequently
in classical writers.</p>

<p class='c034'>20. κατὰ πάντα] as ver. 22. The
rule is stated absolutely, because the
exceptions are so few that they may
be disregarded.</p>

<p class='c034'>εὐάρεστόν ἐστιν] ‘<em>is well pleasing,
commendable</em>’. The received text
supplies this adjective with a dative
of reference τῷ Κυρίῳ (from Ephes.
v. 10), but ἐν Κυρίῳ is unquestionably
the right reading. With the reading
thus corrected εὐάρεστον, like ἀνῆκεν
ver. 18, must be taken absolutely,
as perhaps in Rom. xii. 2 τὸ θέλημα
τοῦ Θἑοῦ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ εὐάρεστον καὶ
τέλειον: comp. Phil. iv. 8 ὅσα σεμνά
... ὅσα προσφιλῆ. The qualification
ἐν Κυρίῳ implies ‘as judged by a
Christian standard’, ‘as judged by
those who are members of Christ’s
body.’</p>

<p class='c034'>21. ἐρεθίζετε] ‘<em>provoke, irritate</em>’.
The other reading παροργίζετε has
higher support, but is doubtless taken
from the parallel passage, Ephes. vi. 4.
‘Irritation’ is the first consequence of
being too exacting with children, and
irritation leads to  moroseness (ἀθυμία).
In 2 Cor. IX. 2 ἐρεθίζειν is used
in a good sense and produces the
opposite result, not despondency but
energy.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀθυμῶσιν] ‘<em>lose heart, become spiritless</em>’,
i.e. ‘go about their task
in a listless, moody, sullen frame of
mind’. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>Fractus animus</em>’</span>, says Bengel,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘pestis juventutis’</span>. In Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Cyr.</cite></span>

in all things to the masters set over
you in the flesh, not rendering them
service only when their eyes are upon
you, as aiming merely to please men,
but serving in all sincerity of heart,
as living in the sight of God and
standing in awe of Him. And in
every thing that ye do, work faithfully
and with all your soul, as labouring
not for men, but for the great Lord
and Master Himself; knowing that ye
have a Master, from whom ye will
receive the glorious inheritance as
your recompense, whether or not ye
may be defrauded of your due by
men. Yes, Christ is your Master and
ye are his slaves. He that does a
wrong shall be requited for his wrong-doing.
I say not this of slaves only,
but of masters also. There is no partiality,
no respect of persons, in God’s
distribution of rewards and punishments.
Therefore, ye masters, do ye
also on your part deal justly and equitably
by your slaves, knowing that ye
too have a Master in heaven’.</p>

<p class='c034'>22. Οἱ δοῦλοι] The relations of
masters and slaves, both here and in
the companion epistle (Ephes. vi.
5–9), are treated at greater length
than is usual with St Paul. Here
especially the expansion of this topic,
compared with the brief space assigned
to the duties of wives and husbands
(vv. 18, 19), or of children and parents
(vv. 20, 21), deserves to be noticed.
The fact is explained by a contemporary
incident in the Apostle’s private
life. His intercourse with Onesimus
had turned his thoughts in this direction.
See above, p. 33, and the introduction
to the Epistle to Philemon:
comp. also the note on ver. 11.</p>

This happy expression
would seem to be the Apostle’s own
coinage. At least there are no traces
of it earlier. Compare ἐθελοθρησκεία
ii. 23. The reading ὀφθαλμοδουλείᾳ
is better supported than ὀφθαλμοδουλείαις,
though the plural is rendered
slightly more probable in itself by its
greater difficulty.</p>

you have still <em>a</em> Master who will recompense
you.’ The absence of the
definite article here (comp. iv. 1) is
the more remarkable, because it is
studiously inserted in the context, vv.
22–24, τὸν Κύριον, τῷ Κυρίῳ, τῷ Κυρίῳ.
In the parallel passage Ephes.
vi. 8 it is παρὰ Κυρίου: for the difference
between the two see Gal. i. 12.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν] ‘<em>the just recompense</em>’,
a common word both in the
lxx and in classical writers, though
not occurring elsewhere in the New
Testament; comp. ἀνταπόδομα Luke
xiv. 12, Rom. xi. 9. The double compound
involves the idea of ‘exact requital’.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῆς κληρονομίας] ‘<em>which consists in
the inheritance</em>’, the genitive of apposition:
see the note on τὴν μερίδα τοῦ
κλήρου, i. 12. There is a paradox involved
in this word: elsewhere the
δοῦλος and the κληρονόμος are contrasted
(Matt. xxi. 35–38, etc., Rom.
viii. 15–17, Gal. iv. 1, 7), but here
the δοῦλος is the κληρονόμος. This he
is because, though δοῦλος ἀνθρώπων, he
is ἀπελεύθερος Κυρίου (1 Cor. vii. 22)
and thus κληρονόμος διὰ Θεοῦ (Gal. iv.
7); comp. Hermas <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Sim.</cite></span> v. 2 ἵνα συγκληρονόμος
γένηται ὁ δοῦλος τῷ ὑιῷ
(with the context).</p>

<p class='c034'>τῷ Κυρίῳ κ.τ.λ.] i.e. ‘<em>you serve</em> as
your master <em>the</em> great <em>Master Christ</em>.’
This clause is added to explain who
is meant by the preceding ἀπὸ Κυρίου.
For this application of Κύριος compare
(besides the parallel passage,
Ephes. vi. 6–9) 1 Cor. vii. 22 ὁ γὰρ
ἐν Κυρίῳ κληθὲις δοῦλος ἀπελεύθερος
Κυρίου ἐστίν κ.τ.λ. It seems best to
take δουλεύετε here as an indicative,
rather than as an imperative; for (1)
The indicative is wanted to explain
the previous ἀπὸ Κυρίου; (2) The imperative
would seem to require ὡς τῷ
Κυρίῳ, as in Ephes. vi. 7 (the correct
text). On the other hand see Rom.
xii. 11.</p>

<p class='c034'>25. ὁ γὰρ ἀδικῶν κ.τ.λ.] Who is
this unrighteous person ? The slave
who defrauds his master of his service,
or the master who defrauds his
slave of his reward? Some interpreters
confine it exclusively to the former;
others to the latter. It seems
best to suppose that both are included.
The connexion of the sentence ὁ γὰρ
ἀδικῶν (where γάρ, not δέ, is certainly
the right reading) points to the slave.
On the other hand the expression
which follows, τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα
κ.τ.λ., suggests the master. Thus
there seems to be a twofold reference;
the warning is suggested by the case
of the slave, but it is extended to the
case of the master; and this accords
with the parallel passage, Ephes. vi. 8
ἕκαστος ὃ ἂν ποίησῃ ἀγαθὸν τοῦτο κομίσεται
παρὰ Κυρίου, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>εἴτε δοῦλος εἴτε
ἐλεύθερος</em>&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='c034'>The recent fault of Onesimus would
make the Apostle doubly anxious to
emphasize the duties of the slave towards
the master, lest in his love for
the offender he should seem to condone
the offence. This same word
ἠδίκησεν is used by St Paul to describe
the crime of Onesimus in Philem. 18.
But on the other hand it is the Apostle’s
business to show that justice
has a double edge. There must be a
<em>reciprocity</em> between the master and
the slave. The philosophers of Greece
taught, and the laws of Rome assumed,
that the slave was a chattel. But a
chattel could have no rights. It would
be absurd to talk of treating a chattel
with justice. St Paul places the relations
of the master and the slave in a
wholly different light. Justice and
equity are the expression of the Divine
mind: and with God there is no
προσωπολημψία. With Him the claims
of the slave are as real as the claims
of the master.</p>

<p class='c034'>κομίσεται] For this sense of the
middle, ‘to recover’, ‘to get back’,
and so (with an accusative of the thing
to be recompensed), ‘to be requited
for’, see e.g. Lev. xx. 17 ἁμαρτίαν κομιοῦνται,
2 Cor. v. 10 κομίσηται ἕκαστος

here it is more doubtful, the
authorities being more equally divided
between κομιεῖται and κομίσεται. See
however the note on γνωρίσουσιν iv. 9.</p>

<p class='c034'>προσωπολημψία] On this word see
the note Gal. ii. 6. This προσωπολημψία,
though generally found on the
side of rank and power, may also be
exercised in favour of the opposite;
Levit. xix. 15 οὐ λήψῃ πρόσωπον πτωχοῦ
οὐδὲ μὴ θαυμάσῃς πρόσωπον δυνάστου.
There would be a tendency in
the mind of the slave to assume that,
because the προσωπολημψία of man
was on the side of the master, there
must be a corresponding προσωπολημψία
of God on the side of the
slave. This assumption is corrected
by St Paul.</p>

It seems a mistake to suppose that
ἰσότης here has anything to do with

<p class='c034'>παρέχεσθε] ‘<em>exhibit on your part</em>.’
The middle παρέχεσθαι, ‘to afford from
oneself,’ will take different shades of
meaning according to the context, as
‘to furnish one’s <em>quota</em>’ (e.g. Herod.

(esp. of witnesses, e.g.

<p class='c033'>2–6. ‘Be earnest and unceasing
in prayer; keep your hearts and minds
awake while praying: remember also
(as I have so often told you) that
thanksgiving is the goal and crown of
prayer. Meanwhile in your petitions
forget not us—myself Paul—my fellow-labourer
Timothy—your evangelist
Epaphras—all the teachers of the
Gospel; but pray that God may open
a door for the preaching of the word,
to the end that we may proclaim the
free offer of grace to the Gentiles—that
great mystery of Christ for which
I am now a prisoner in bonds. So
shall I declare it fearlessly, as I am
bound to proclaim it. Walk wisely
and discreetly in all your dealings with
unbelievers; allow no opportunity to
slip through your hands, but buy up
every passing moment. Let your language
be always pervaded with grace
and seasoned with salt. So will you
know how to give a fit answer to each
man, as the occasion demands.’</p>

<p class='c034'>2. προσκαρτερεῖτε] ‘<em>cling closely
to</em>’, ‘<em>remain constant to</em>’ (comp. Mark
iii. 9, Acts viii. 13, x. 7), and so ‘continue
stedfast in’. This word occurs
again with τῇ προσευχῇ, ταῖς προσευχαῖς,
Acts i. 14, ii. 42, vi. 4, Rom. xii.
12. The construction is with a simple
dative both in the New Testament
(ll. cc.) and in classical writers, except
where it stands absolutely (Acts ii. 46,
Rom. xiii. 6). The injunction here
corresponds to the ἀδιαλέιπτως προσεύχεσθε
of 1 Thess. v. 17.</p>

<p class='c034'>γρηγοροῦντες] Long continuance in
prayer is apt to produce listlessness.
Hence the additional charge that the
heart must be <em>awake</em>, if the prayer
is to have any value. The word is not
to be taken literally here, but metaphorically.
In Matt. xxvi. 41 etc., γρηγορεῖτε
καὶ προσεύχεσθε, the idea is not
quite the same.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ] as the crown of all
prayer; see the notes on i. 12, ii. 7.</p>

<p class='c034'>3. ἡμῶν] ‘<em>us</em>’, ‘the Apostles and
preachers of the Gospel’, with reference
more especially to Timothy (i. 1)
and Epaphras (iv. 12, 13). Where
the Apostle speaks of himself alone,
he uses the singular (ver. 3, 4 δέδεμαι,
φανερώσω). Indeed there is no reason
to think that St Paul ever uses an
‘epistolary’ plural, referring to himself
solely: see the note on 1 Thess.
iii. 1.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἵνα κ.τ.λ.] On the sense of ἵνα after
προσεύχεσθαι etc., see the note on <a href='#I_9'>i. 9</a>.</p>

<p class='c034'>θύραν τοῦ λόγου] ‘<em>a door</em> of admission
<em>for the word</em>’, i.e. ‘an opportunity
of preaching the Gospel’, as
1 Cor. xvi. 9 θύρα γάρ μοι ἀνέῳγεν
μεγάλη καὶ ἐνεργής, 2 Cor. ii. 12
θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης ἐν Κυρίῳ: comp.

οὐκ ἀντέσχον ... συνεισιοῦσι

is used in 1 Thess. i. 9, ii. 1. The
converse application of the metaphor
appears in Acts xiv. 27 ἤνοιξεν τοῖς
ἔθνεσιν θύραν πίστεως, where the door
is opened not to the teachers, but to
the recipients of the Gospel. According
to another interpretation (suggested
by Ephes. vi. 19 ἵνα μοι δοθῇ λόγος
ἐν ἀνοίζει τοῦ στόματος μου) it is explained
‘the door of our speech’, i.e.
‘our mouth’: comp. Ps. cxli (cxl). 3,
Mic. vii. 5, Ecclus. xxviii. 25. But the
parallel passages do not favour this
sense, nor will the words themselves
admit it. In that case for ἡμῖν θύραν
τοῦ λόγου we should require τὴν θύραν
τῶν λόγωυ [ἡμῶν]. ‘The word’ here is
‘the Gospel’, as frequently.</p>

<p class='c034'>λαλῆσαι ‘<em>so as to speak</em>’, the infinitive
of the consequence, like εἰδέναι
ver. 6 ; see Winer § xliv, p. 400.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸ μυστήριον κ.τ.λ. i.e. the doctrine
of the free admission of the Gentiles.
For the leading idea which St Paul
in these epistles attaches to ‘the mystery’
of the Gospel, see the note on
i. 26.</p>

<p class='c034'>δι’ ὅ St Paul might have been still
at large, if he had been content to
preach a Judaic Gospel. It was because
he contended for Gentile liberty,
and thus offended Jewish prejudices,
that he found himself a prisoner. See
Acts xxi. 28, xxii. 21, 22, xxiv. 5, 6,
xxv. 6, 8. The other reading, δι’ ὅν,
destroys the point of the sentence.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ δέδεμαι 2 Tim. ii. 9 μέχρι δεσμῶν,
Philem. 9 νυνὶ δὲ καὶ δέσμιος.</p>

<p class='c034'>4. ἵνα φανερώσω κ.τ.λ. This is
best taken as dependent on the previous
clause ἵνα ὁ Θεός ... τοῦ Χριστοῦ.
For instances of a double ἵνα, where
the second is not coordinated with,
but subordinated to, the first, see the
note on Gal. iii. 14. The immediate
purport of the Colossians’ prayers
must be that the Apostle should have
all opportunities of preaching the
Gospel: the ulterior object, that he
should use these opportunities boldly.</p>

from corruption and renders wholesome;

Laert. viii. <span class='fss'>I.</span> 35 οἱ ἅλες πᾶν σώζουσιν

that this secondary application

the parallel epistle, Ephes. iv. 29, he
says πᾶς λόγος &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>σαπρὸς</em>&nbsp; ἐκ τοῦ στόματος

as regards the person’. The Apostle’s
precept was enforced by his own example,
for he made it a rule to become
τοῖς πᾶσιν πάντα, ἵνα πάντως τινὰς
σώσῃ (1 Cor. ix. 22).</p>

<p class='c034'>7–9. ‘You will learn everything
about me from Tychicus, the beloved
brother who has ministered to me
and served with me faithfully in the
Lord. This indeed was my purpose
in sending him to you: that you might
be informed how matters stand with
me, and that he might cheer your
hearts and strengthen your resolves
by the tidings. Onesimus will accompany
him—a faithful and beloved brother,
who is one of yourselves, a Colossian.
These two will inform you of
all that is going on here.’</p>

<p class='c034'>7. Τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντα] ‘<em>all that
relates to me</em>’; see the note on
Phil. i. 12, and comp. Bion in Diog.
Laert. iv. 47. So Acts xxv. 14 τὰ κατὰ
τὸν Παῦλον.</p>

<p class='c034'>γνωρίσει] On this word see the
note Phil. i. 22.</p>

<p class='c034'>Τύχικος] Tychicus was charged by
St Paul at this same time with a more
extended mission. He was entrusted
with copies of the circular letter,
which he was enjoined to deliver in
the principal churches of proconsular
Asia (see above, p. 37, and the introduction
to the Epistle to the Ephesians).
This mission would bring him
to Laodicea, which was one of these
great centres of Christianity (see p. <a href='#Page_8'>8</a>);
and, as Colossæ was only a few miles
distant, the Apostle would naturally
engage him to pay a visit to the Colossians.
At the same time the presence
of an authorised delegate of St
Paul, as Tychicus was known to be,
would serve to recommend Onesimus,
who owing to his former conduct
stood in every need of such a recommendation.
The two names Τύχικος
and Ὀνήσιμος occur in proximity in
Phrygian inscriptions found at Altentash
(Bennisoa?) Boeckh 3857r sqq.
appx.</p>

<p class='c034'>Tychicus was a native of proconsular
Asia (Acts xx. 4) and perhaps of
Ephesus (2 Tim. iv. 12: see <cite>Philippians</cite>
p. 11). He is found with St Paul
at three different epochs in his life.
(1) He accompanied him when on
his way eastward at the close of the
third missionary journey <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 58 (Acts
xx. 4), and probably like Trophimus
(Acts xxi. 29) went with him to Jerusalem
(for the words ἄχρι τῆς Ἀσίας
must be struck out in Acts xx. 4). It
is probable indeed that Tychicus, together
with others mentioned among
the Apostle’s numerous retinue on this
occasion, was a delegate appointed by
his own church according to the Apostle’s
injunctions (1 Cor. xvi. 3, 4) to
bear the contributions of his brethren
to the poor Christians of Judæa; and
if so, he may possibly be the person
commended as the brother οὗ ὁ ἔπαινος
ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ διὰ πασῶν τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν
(2 Cor. viii. 18): but this will
depend on the interpretation of the
best supported reading in Acts xx. 5
οὗτοι δὲ προσελθόντες ἔμενον ἡμᾶς ἐν
Τρωάδι. (2) We find Tychicus again
in St Paul’s company at the time with
which we are immediately concerned,
when this epistle was written, probably
towards the end of the first Roman
captivity <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 62, 63 (see <cite>Philippians</cite>
p. 31 sq.). (3) Once more, at the
close of St Paul’s life (about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 67),
he appears again to have associated
himself with the Apostle, when his
name is mentioned in connexion with
a mission to Crete (Tit. iii. 12) and
another to Ephesus (2 Tim. iv. 12).
For the legends respecting him, which
are slight and insignificant, see <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Act.
Sanct. Boll.</cite></span> April. 29 (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 619).</p>

<p class='c034'>Tychicus is not so common a name
as some others which occur in the
New Testament, e.g. Onesimus, Trophimus;
but it is found occasionally
in inscriptions belonging to Asia Minor,
e.g. Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>C. I.</cite></span> 2918, 3665,
[3857 c], 3857 r, (comp. 3865 i, etc.);
and persons bearing it are commemorated
on the coins of both Magnesia
ad Mæandrum (Mionnet <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 153 sq.,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Suppl.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VI.</span> p. 236) and Magnesia ad
Sipylum (<em>ib.</em> <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 70). The name
occurs also in Roman inscriptions; e.g.
Muratori, pp. <span class='fss'>DCCCCXVII</span>, <span class='fss'>MCCCXCIV</span>,
<span class='fss'>MMLV</span>. Along with several other
proper names similarly formed, this
word is commonly accentuated Τυχικός
(Chandler <cite>Greek Accentuation</cite> § 255),
and so it stands in all the critical
Seditions, though according to rule
(Winer § vi. p. 58) it should be Τύχικος.</p>

ἀδελφὸς καὶ πιστὸς δίακονος καὶ σύνδουλος ἐν

<a href='#Page_301'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>καὶ πιστὸς κ.τ.λ.] The connexion of
the words is not quite obvious. It
seems best however to take ἐν Κυρίῳ
as referring to the whole clause πιστὸς
δίακονος καὶ σύνδουλος rather than to
σύνδουλος alone: for (1) The two substantives
are thus bound together by
the preceding πιστός and the following
ἐν Κυρίῳ in a natural way: (2) The attachment
of ἐν Κυρίῳ to πιστὸς δίακονος
is suggested by the parallel passage
Ephes. vi. 21 Τύχικος ὁ ἀγαπητὸς
ἀδελφὸς καὶ πιστὸς δίακονος ἐν Κυρίῳ.
The question of connecting ἐν Κυρίῳ
with ἀδελπὅς as well need not be entertained,
since the idea of ἀδελπὅς,
‘a Christian brother’, is complete in
itself: see the note on Phil. i. 14. The
adjective πιστός will here have its
passive sense, ‘trustworthy, stedfast’,
as also in ver. 9: see <cite>Galatians</cite> p.
154 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>δίακονος] ‘<em>minister</em>’, but to whom?
To the churches, or to St Paul himself?
The following σύνδουλος suggests
the latter as the prominent idea
here. So in Acts xix. 22 Timothy and
Erastus are described as δύο τῶν διακονούντων
αὐτῷ. Tychicus himself also
was one of several who ministered to
St Paul about that same time (Acts
xx. 4). It is not probable however,
that δίακονος has here its strict official
sense, ‘a deacon’, as in Rom. xvi. 1,
Phil. i. 1, 1 Tim. iii. 8, 12.</p>

<p class='c034'>σύνδουλος] The word does not occur
elsewhere in St Paul, except in
i. 7, where it is said of Epaphras. It is
probably owing to the fact of St Paul’s
applying the term in both these passages
to persons whom he calls δίακονοι,
that σύνδουλος seems to have been
adopted as a customary form of address
in the early Church on the part
of a bishop, when speaking of a deacon.
In Ignatian letters for instance,
the term is never used except of deacons;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ephes.</cite></span> 2, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Magn.</cite></span> 2, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Philad.</cite></span> 4,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Smyrn.</cite></span> 12. Where the martyr has
occasion to speak of a bishop or a
presbyter some other designation is
used instead.</p>

<p class='c034'>8. ἔπεμψα] ‘<em>I send</em>,’ or ‘<em>I have
sent</em>,’ ἔπεμψα being the epistolary
aorist; see the note on ἔγραψα, Gal.
vi. 11. Tychicus appears to have accompanied
the letter itself. For similar
instances of the epistolary ἔπεμψα,
ἐπέστειλα, etc., see 2 Cor. viii. 18, 22,
ix. 3, Ephes. vi. 22, Phil. ii. 25, 28,

<a id='IV_9'></a><sup>9</sup>σὺν Ὀνησίμῳ τῷ πιστῷ καὶ ἀγαπητῷ ἀδελφῷ, ὅς

<a href='#Page_302'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'><a id='n301_1'></a>γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν] This must be
preferred to the received reading, γνῷ
τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν, for two independent
reasons. (1) The preponderance of
ancient authority is decidedly in its
favour. (2) The emphatic εἰς αὐτὸ
τοῦτο ἵνα seems imperatively to demand
it. St Paul in the context
twice states the object of Tychicus’
visit to be that the Colossians might
be informed about the Apostle’s own
doings, τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντα γνωρίσει ὑμῖν
(ver. 7), and πάντα ὑμῖν γνωρίσουσιν τὰ
ὧδε. He could hardly therefore have
described ‘the very purpose’ of his
mission in the same breath as something
quite different.</p>

<p class='c034'>It is urged indeed, that this is a
scribe’s alteration to bring the passage
into accordance with Ephes. vi. 21.
But against this it may fairly be argued
that, on any hypothesis as regards
the authorship and relation of
the two letters, this strange variation
from γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν to γνῷ
τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν in the author himself is
improbable. On the other hand a
transcriber was under a great temptation
to substitute γνῷ for γνῶτε owing
to the following παρακαλέση, and
this temptation would become almost
irresistible, if by any chance περὶ ὑμῶν
had been written for περὶ ἡμῶν in the
copy before him, as we find to be the
case in some <span class='fss'>MSS.</span> See the detached
note on various readings.</p>

<p class='c034'>παρακαλέσῃ κ.τ.λ.] i.e. ‘encourage
you to persevere by his tidings and exhortations’.
The phrase occurs again,
Ephes. vi. 22, 2 Thess, ii. 17: see above
ii. 2. The prominent idea in all these
passages is not comfort or consolation
but perseverance in the right way.</p>

<p class='c034'>9. σὺν Ὀνησίμῳ] See above, p. 33,
and the introduction to the Epistle to
Philemon.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῷ πιστῷ κ.τ.λ.] The man whom the
Colossians had only known hitherto,
if they knew him at all, as a worthless
runaway slave, is thus commended to
them as no more a slave but a brother,
no more dishonest and faithless but
trustworthy, no more an object of contempt
but of love; comp. Philem. 11,
16.</p>

<p class='c034'>γνωρίσουσιν] This form has rather
better support from the <span class='fss'>MSS</span> than
γνωριοῦσιν: see also above, iii. 25. On
the Attic future from verbs in -ιζω in
the Greek Testament generally see
Winer § xiii. p. 88, A. Buttmann p. 32
sq. Is there any decisive instance of
these Attic forms in St Paul, except in
quotations from the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> (e.g. Rom. x.
19, xv. 12)?</p>

<p class='c034'>10–14. ‘I send you greeting from
Aristarchus who is a fellow-prisoner
with me; from Marcus, Barnabas’
cousin, concerning whom I have already
sent you directions, that you
welcome him heartily, if he pays you
a visit; and from Jesus, surnamed
Justus; all three Hebrew converts.
They alone of their fellow-countrymen
have worked loyally with me in spreading
the kingdom of God; and their
stedfastness has indeed been a comfort
to me in the hour of trial. Greeting
also from Epaphras, your fellow-townsman,
a true servant of Christ,
who is ever wrestling in his prayers on
your behalf, that ye may stand firm
in the faith, perfectly instructed and
fully convinced in every will and purpose
of God. I bear testimony to the
earnestness with which he labours for

are sent from the same persons as to
the Colossians, except that in the
former case the name of Jesus Justus
is omitted.</p>

<p class='c034'>Ἀρίσταρχος] the Thessalonian. He
had started with St Paul on his voyage
from Jerusalem to Rome, but
probably had parted from the Apostle
at Myra (see <cite>Philippians</cite> p. 33 sq.).
If so, he must have rejoined him
at Rome at a later date. On this
Aristarchus see <cite>Philippians</cite> p. 10
and the introduction to the Epistles
to the Thessalonians. He would be
well known in proconsular Asia, which
he had visited from time to time;
Acts xix. 29, xx. 4, xxvii. 2.</p>

<p class='c034'>συναιχμάλωτός μου] In Philem. 23
this honourable title is withheld from
Aristarchus and given to Epaphras.
In Rom. xvi. 7 St Paul’s kinsmen,
Andronicus and Junias, are so called.
On the possibility of its referring to a
spiritual captivity or subjection see
<cite>Philippians</cite> p. 11. In favour of this
meaning it may be urged, that, though
St Paul as a prisoner was truly a δέσμιος,
he was not strictly an αἰχμάλωτος
‘a prisoner of war’; nor could he have
called himself so, except by a confusion
of the actual and metaphorical.
If on the other hand συναιχμάλωτος
refers to a physical captivity, it cannot
easily be explained by any known fact.
The incident in Acts xix. 29 is hardly
adequate. The most probable solution
would be, that his relations with
St Paul in Rome excited suspicion
and led to a temporary confinement.
Another possible hypothesis is that
he voluntarily shared the Apostle’s
captivity by living with him.</p>

<p class='c034'>Μάρκος] doubtless John Mark, who
had been associated with St Paul in
his earlier missionary work; Acts xii.
25, xv. 37 sq. This commendatory
notice is especially interesting as being
the first mention of him since the
separation some twelve years before,
Acts xv. 39. In the later years of the
Apostle’s life he entirely effaced the
unfavourable impression left by his
earlier desertion; 2 Tim. iv. 11 ἔστιν γάρ
μοι εὔχρηστος εἰς διακονίαν.</p>

<p class='c034'>This notice is likewise important in
two other respects. (1) Mark appears
here as commended to a church of
proconsular <em>Asia</em>, and intending to
visit those parts. To the churches of
this same region he sends a salutation
in 1 Pet. v. 13; and in this district
apparently also he is found some few
years later than the present time,
2 Tim. iv. 11. (2) Mark is now residing
at <em>Rome</em>. His connexion with the
metropolis appears also from 1 Pet. v.
13, if Βαβυλῶν there (as seems most
probable) be rightly interpreted of
Rome; and early tradition speaks of
his Gospel as having been written for
the Romans (Iren. iii. 1. 1; comp.
Papias in Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> iii. 39).</p>

<p class='c033'>ὁ ἀνεψιὸς] ‘<em>the cousin</em>’. The term
ἀνεψιοί is applied to cousins german,
the children whether of two brothers
or of two sisters or of a brother and
sister, as it is carefully defined in
Pollux iii. 28. This writer adds that
αὐτανέψιοι means neither more nor
less than ἀνεψιοί. As a synonyme
we find ἐξάδελφος, which however is
condemned as a vulgarism; Phryn.
p. 306 (ed. Lobeck). Many instances of
ἀνεψιοί are found in different authors
of various ages (e.g. Herod, vii. 5, 82,

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial. Mort.</cite></span> xxix. 1, Hegesipp. in
Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> iv. 22), where the relationship
is directly defined or already
known, and there is no wavering as to
the meaning. This sense also it has in
the <span class='fss'>LXX</span>, Num. xxxvi. 11. In very late
writers however (e.g. Io. Malalas
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Chron.</cite></span> xvii. p. 424, Io. Damasc. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv.
Const. Cab.</cite></span> 12, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 621; but in Theodt.
<cite>H.E.</cite> v. 39, which is also quoted by
E. A. Sophocles <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Gr. Lex.</cite></span> s.v. for
this meaning, the text is doubtful)
the word comes to be used for a
nephew, properly ἀδελφιδοῦς; and
to this later use the rendering of
our English versions must be traced.
The German translations also (Luther
and the Zürich) have ‘Neffe’. The
earliest of the ancient versions (Latin,
Syriac, Egyptian) seem all to translate
it correctly; not so in every case apparently
the later. There is no reason
to suppose that St Paul would or
could have used it in any other than
its proper sense. St Mark’s relationship
with Barnabas may have been
through his mother Mary, who is mentioned
Acts xii. 12. The incidental
notice here explains why Barnabas
should have taken a more favourable
view of Mark’s defection than St
Paul, Acts xv. 37–39. The notices in
this passage and in 2 Tim. iv. 11 show
that Mark had recovered the Apostle’s
good opinion. The studious recommendation
of St Mark in both
passages indicates a desire to efface
the unfavourable impression of the
past.</p>

<p class='c034'>The name of Mark occurs in five
different relations, as (1) The early
disciple, John Mark, Acts xii. 12, 25,
xv. 39; (2) The later companion of St
Paul, here and Philem. 24, 2 Tim. iv.
11; (3) The companion and ‘son’ of
St Peter, 1 Pet. v. 13; (4) The evangelist;
(5) The bishop of Alexandria.
Out of these notices some writers get
three or even four distinct persons
(see the note of Cotelier on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apost.
Const.</cite></span> ii. 57). Even Tillemont (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mem.
Eccl.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 89 sq., 503 sq.) assumes two
Marks, supposing (1) (2) to refer to
one person, and (3) (4) (5) to another.
His main reason is that he cannot
reconcile the notices of the first with
the tradition (Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> ii. 15, 16)
that St Mark the evangelist accompanied
St Peter to Rome in <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 43,
having first preached the Gospel in
Alexandria (p. 515). To most persons
however this early date of St Peter’s
visit to Rome will appear quite irreconcilable
with the notices in the
Apostolic writings, and therefore
with them Tillemont’s argument will
carry no weight. But in fact Eusebius
does not say, either that St Mark
went <em>with</em> St Peter to Rome, or that
he had preached in Alexandria <em>before</em>
this. The Scriptural notices suggest
that the same Mark is intended in all
the occurrences of the name, for they
are connected together by personal
links (Peter, Paul, Barnabas); and the
earliest forms of tradition likewise
identify them.</p>

<p class='c034'>Βαρνάβα] On the affectionate tone
of St Paul’s language, whenever he
mentions Barnabas after the collision
at Antioch (Gal. ii. 11 sq.) and
the separation of missionary spheres
(Acts xv. 39), see the note on Gal. ii.
13. It has been inferred from the
reference here, that inasmuch as Mark
has rejoined St Paul, Barnabas must
have died before this epistle was
written (about <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 63); and this has
been used as an argument against
the genuineness of the letter bearing
his name (Hefele <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Sendschr. d.
Apost. Barnab.</cite></span> p. 29 sq.); but this
argument is somewhat precarious.
From 1 Cor. ix. 6 we may infer that
he was still living, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 57. The
notices bearing on the biography of
Barnabas are collected and discussed
by Hefele, p. 1 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐλάβετε ἐντολάς] These injunctions
must have been communicated previously
either by letter or by word of
mouth: for it cannot be a question
here of an epistolary aorist. The
natural inference is, that they were
sent by St Paul himself, and not by
any one else, e.g. by St Peter or St
Barnabas, as some have suggested.
Thus the notice points to earlier communications
between the Apostle and
Colossæ.</p>

<p class='c034'>But what was their tenour?  It
seems best to suppose that this is
given in the next clause  ἐὰν ἔλθῃ
κ.τ.λ. By an abrupt change to the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>oratio recta</em></span> the injunction is repeated
as it was delivered; comp. Ps.
cv (civ). 15  ἤλεγξεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν βασιλεῖς·
μὴ ἅψησθε κ.τ.λ. After verbs
signifying ‘to command, charge, etc.’,
there is a tendency to pass from the
oblique to the direct; e.g. Luke v. 14,
Acts i. 4, xxiii. 22. The reading δέξασθαι
gives the right sense, but can
hardly be correct. If this construction
be not accepted, it is vain to
speculate what may have been the
tenour of the injunction.</p>

<p class='c033'>11. καὶ Ἰησοῦς] He is not mentioned
elsewhere. Even in the Epistle
to Philemon his name is omitted.
Probably he was not a man of any
prominence in the Church, but his
personal devotion to the Apostle
prompted this honourable mention.
For the story which makes him bishop
of Eleutheropolis in Palestine, see Le
Quien <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Oriens Christ.</cite></span> in <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 633.</p>

<p class='c034'>Ἰοῦστος] A common name or surname
of Jews and proselytes, denoting
obedience and devotion to the
law. It is applied to two persons in
the New Testament, besides this Jesus;
(1) Joseph Barsabbas, Acts i. 23;
(2) A proselyte at Corinth, Acts xviii.
7. It occurs twice in the list of early
Jewish Christian bishops of Jerusalem,
in Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> iii. 35, iv. 5. It
was borne by a Jew of Tiberias who
wrote the history of the Jewish war
(Joseph. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit.</cite></span> §§ 9, 65), and by a son
of the historian Josephus himself (<em>ib.</em>
§ 1). It occurs in the rabbinical writings
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">יוסטא</span> or <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">יוסטי</span>, Schöttgen on
Acts. i. 23, Zunz <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Judennamen</cite></span> p. 20),
and in monumental inscriptions from
Jewish cemeteries in various places
(Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>C. I.</cite></span> no. 9922, 9925; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Revue

<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Dissertazioni Archeologiche</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span>
p. 182). So also the corresponding
female name Justa (Garrucci <em>l.c.</em> p.
180). In <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> ii. 19, iii. 73, iv.
1, xiii. 7, the Syroph&oelig;nician woman
of the Gospels is named Ἰοῦστα,
doubtless because she is represented
in this Judaizing romance as a proselytess
προσήλυτος xiii. 7) who strictly
observes the Mosaic ordinances ( τὴν
νόμιμον ἀναδεξαμένη πολιτείαν ii. 20),
and is contrasted with the heathen
‘dogs’ ( τὰ ἔθνη ἐοικότα κυσίν ii. 19)
who disregard them. In some cases
Justus might be the only name of the
person, as a Latin rendering of the
Hebrew Zadok; while in others, as
here and in Acts i. 23, it is a surname.
Its Greek equivalent, ὁ δίκαιος, is the
recognised epithet of James the Lord’s
brother: see <cite>Galatians</cite>, p. 348.</p>

<p class='c034'>οἱ ὄντες κ.τ.λ.] i.e. ‘converts from
Judaism’ (see the note Gal. ii. 12),
or perhaps ‘belonging to the Circumcision’;
but in this latter case
περιτομῆς, though without the article,
must be used in a concrete sense,
like τῆς περιτομῆς, for ‘the Jews’.
Of Mark and of Jesus the fact is
plain from their name or their connexions.
Of Aristarchus we could not
have inferred a Jewish origin, independently
of this direct statement.</p>

<p class='c034'>μόνοι] i.e. of the Jewish Christians
in Rome. On this antagonism of the
converts from the Circumcision in the
metropolis, see <cite>Philippians</cite> p. 16 sq.
The words however must not be closely pressed,
as if absolutely no Jewish
Christian besides had remained friendly;
they will only imply that among
the more prominent members of
the body the Apostle can only name
these three as stedfast in their allegiance:

For οἵτινες, not specifying the individuals,
but referring them to their
class characteristics, see the notes on
Gal. iv. 24, v. 19, Phil. iii. 7, iv. 3.</p>

<p class='c034'>παρηγορία] ‘<em>encouragement</em>’, ‘<em>comfort</em>’.
The range of meaning in this
word is even wider than in παραμυθία
or παράκλησις (see the note Phil.
ii. 1). The verb παρηγορεῖν denotes
either (1) ‘to exhort, encourage’ (Herod.
v. 104, Apoll. Rhod. ii. 64);
(2) ‘to dissuade’ (Herod. ix. 54, 55);
(3) ‘to appease’, ‘quiet’ (Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vit.
Pomp.</cite></span> 13, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 737 <span class='fss'>C</span>); or (4) ‘to
console, comfort’ (Æsch. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eum.</cite></span> 507).
The word however, and its derivates
παρηγορία, παρηγόρημα, παρηγορικός,
παρηγορητικός, were used especially as
medical terms, in the sense of ‘assuaging’,
‘alleviating’; e.g. Hippocr.
pp. 392, 393, 394, Galen <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> p. 335,
446, Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> pp. 43 <span class='fss'>D</span>, 142 <span class='fss'>D</span>; and
perhaps owing to this usage, the idea
of consolation, comfort, is on the whole
predominant in the word; e.g. Plut.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 56 <span class='fss'>A</span> τὰς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀτυχήμασι
παρηγοπίας, p. 118 <span class='fss'>A</span> τοῖς ἀφαιρουμένοις

τοῦ πένθους. In Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> p. 599 <span class='fss'>B</span>
παρηγορία and συνηγορία are contrasted,
as the right and wrong method
of dealing with the sorrows of
the exile; and the former is said to
be the part of men παρῥησιαζομένων

<p class='c034'>12. Ἐπαφρᾶς] His full name would
be Epaphroditus, but he is always
called by the shortened form Epaphras,
and must not be confused with
the Philippian Epaphroditus (see <cite>Philippians</cite>
p. 60), who also was with St
Paul at one period of his Roman
captivity. Of Epaphras, as the evangelist
of Colossæ, and perhaps of the
neighbouring towns, see above, pp. 29
sq., 34 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὁ ἐξ ὑμῶν] ‘<em>who belongs to you</em>’,
‘<em>who is one of you</em>’, i.e. a native, or
at least an inhabitant, of Colossæ, as
in the case of Onesimus ver. 9; comp.
Acts iv. 6, xxi. 8, Rom. xvi. 10, 11,
1 Cor. xii. 16, Phil. iv. 22, etc.</p>

<p class='c034'>δοῦλος Χ. Ἰ.] This title, which the
Apostle uses several times of himself,
is not elsewhere conferred on any
other individual, except once on
Timothy (Phil. i. 1), and probably
points to exceptional services in the
cause of the Gospel on the part of
Epaphras.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀγωνιζόμενος] ‘<em>wrestling</em>’; comp.

<p class='c033'>πεπληροφορημένοι] ‘<em>fully persuaded</em>’.
The verb πληροφορεῖν has several
senses. (1) ‘To fulfil, accomplish’; 2
Tim. iv. 5 τὴν διακονίαν σου πληροφόρησον,
<em>ib.</em> ver. 17 τὸ κήρυγμα πληροφορηθῇ,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> xix. 24 πεπληροφορημένον

τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτῶν ... πληροφοροῦσι
τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν, though it is a
little difficult to carry the same sense
into the latter clause, where the word
seems to signify rather ‘to satisfy’.
(2)‘To persuade fully, to convince’;

too <span class='fss'>LXX</span> Eccles. viii. 11 ἐπληροφορήθη

Rom. 54 τίς πεπληροφορημένος ἀγάπης;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Test. xii Patr.</cite></span> Dan 2 τῇ πλεονεξίᾳ
ἐπληροφορήθην τῆς ἀναιρέσεως
αὐτοῦ, where it means ‘I was filled
with’, i.e. ‘I was fully bent on’, a
sense closely allied to the last. From
this account it will be seen that there
is in the usage of the word no
justification for translating it ‘most
surely believed’ in Luke i. 1 τῶν
πεπληροφορημένων ἐν ἡμῖν πραγμάτων,
and it should therefore be rendered
‘fulfilled, accomplished’. The word
is almost exclusively biblical and ecclesiastical;
and it seems clear that
the passage from Ctesias in Photius
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Bibl.</cite></span> 72) πολλοῖς λόγοις καὶ ὅρκοις
πληροφορήσαντες Μεγάβυζον is not
quoted with verbal exactness. In
Isocr. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Trapez.</cite></span> § 8 the word is now
expunged from the text on the authority
of the <span class='fss'>MSS</span>. For the substantive
πληροφορία see the note on ii. 2 above.
The reading of the received text here,
πεπληρωμένοι, must be rejected as of
inferior authority.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν παντὶ κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>in every thing
willed by God</em>’; comp. 1 Kings ix. 11.
So the plural τὰ θελήματα in Acts
xiii. 22, Ephes. ii. 3, and several times
in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span>. The words are best connected
directly with πεπληροφορημένοι.
The passages quoted in the last note
amply illustrate this construction. The
preposition may denote (1) The abode
of the conviction, as Rom. xiv. 5 ἐν τῷ
ἰδίῳ νοΐ; or (2) The object of the
conviction, as Ign. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Magn.</cite></span> II ἐν τῇ
γεννήσει, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Philad.</cite></span> inscr. ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει;
or (3) The atmosphere, the
surroundings, of the conviction, as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Philad.</cite></span> inscr. ἐν παντὶ )ελέει. This
last seems to be its sense here. The
connexion σταθῆτε ... ἐν, though legitimate
in itself (Rom. v. 2, 1 Cor. xv.
1), is not favoured by the order of
the words here.</p>

<p class='c034'>13. πολὺν πόνον] ‘<em>much toil</em>’, both
inward and outward, though from the
connexion the former notion seems to
predominate, as in ἀγῶνα ii. 1; comp.
Plat. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phædr.</cite></span> p. 247 <span class='fss'>B</span> πόνος τε καὶ
ἀγὼν ἔσχατος ψυχῇ πρόκειται. Of the
two variations which transcribers
have substituted for the correct reading,
ζῆλον emphasizes the former idea
and κόπον the latter. The true reading
is more expressive than either.
The word πόνος however is very
rare in the New Testament (occurring
only Rev. xvi. 10, 11, xxi. 4,
besides this passage), and was therefore
liable to be changed.</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ τῶν κ.τ.λ.] The neighbouring
cities are taken in their geographical
order, commencing from Colossæ; see
above, p. 2. Epaphras, though a Colossian,
may have been the evangelist
of the two larger cities also.</p>

<a href='#Page_308'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>Λαοδικίᾳ] This form has not the same
overwhelming preponderance of authority
in its favour here and in vv.
15, 16, as in ii. 1, but is probably correct
in all these places. It is quite
possible however, that the same person
would write Λαοδικια and Λαοδικεια
indifferently. Even the form Λαοδικηα
is found in Mionnet, Suppl. <span class='fss'>VII.</span>
p. 581. Another variation is the contraction
of Λαοδ- into Λαδ-; e.g. Λαδικηνός,
which occurs frequently in the
edict of Diocletian.</p>

<p class='c034'>14. Λουκᾶς] St Luke had travelled
with St Paul on his last journey to
Jerusalem (Acts xxi. 1 sq.). He
had also accompanied him two
years later from Jerusalem to Rome
(Acts xxvii. 2 sq.). And now again,
probably after another interval of two
years (see <cite>Philippians</cite> p. 31 sq.), we
find him in the Apostle’s company.
It is not probable that he remained
with St Paul in the meanwhile (<cite>Philippians</cite>
p. 35), and this will account
for his name not occurring in the
Epistle to the Philippians. He was
at the Apostle’s side again in his
second captivity (2 Tim. iv. 11).</p>

<p class='c034'>Lucas is doubtless a contraction
of Lucanus. Several Old Latin <span class='fss'>MSS</span>
write out the name <em>Lucanus</em> in the
superscription and subscription to the
Gospel, just as elsewhere Apollos is
written in full Apollonius. On the
frequent occurrence of this name Lucanus
in inscriptions see <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ephem.
Epigr.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 28 (1874). The shortened
form Lucas however seems to be
rare. He is here distinguished from
οἱ ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς (ver. 11). This
alone is fatal to his identification
(mentioned as a tradition by Origen
<em>ad loc.</em>) with the Lucius, St Paul’s
‘kinsman’ (i.e. a Jew; see <cite>Philippians</cite>
pp. 17, 171, 173), who sends
a salutation from Corinth to Rome
(Rom. xvi. 21). It is equally fatal to
the somewhat later tradition that he
was one of the seventy (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dial. c. Marc.</cite></span>
§ 1 in Orig. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 806, ed. De la
Rue; Epiphan. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hær.</cite></span> li. 11). The identification
with Lucius of Cyrene (Acts
xiii. 13) is possible but not probable.
Though the example of Patrobius for
Patrobas (Rom. xvi. 14) shows that such
a contraction is not out of the question,
yet probability and testimony
alike point to Lucanus, as the longer
form of the Evangelist’s name.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὁ ἰατρὸς] Indications of medical
knowledge have been traced both in
the third Gospel and in the Acts; see
on this point Smith’s <cite>Voyage and
Shipwreck of St Paul</cite> p. 6 sq. (ed. 2).
It has been observed also, that St
Luke’s first appearance in company
with St Paul (Acts xvi. 10) nearly synchronizes
with an attack of the Apostle’s
constitutional malady (Gal. iv.
13, 14); so that he may have joined
him partly in a professional capacity.
This conjecture is perhaps borne out
by the personal feeling which breathes
in the following ὁ ἀγαπητός. But
whatever may be thought of these
points, there is no ground for questioning
the ancient belief (Iren. iii. 14.
1 sq.) that the physician is also the
Evangelist. St Paul’s motive in specifying
him as the physician may not
have been to distinguish him from any
other bearing the same name, but to
emphasize his own obligations to his
medical knowledge. The name in this
form does not appear to have been
common. The tradition that St Luke
was a painter is quite late (Niceph.
Call. ii. 43). It is worthy of notice
that the two Evangelists are mentioned
together in this context, as also
in Philem. 24, 2 Tim. iv. 11.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὁ ἀγαπητός] ‘<em>the beloved one</em>’, not to
be closely connected with ὁ ἰατρός, for
ὁ ἀγαπητός is complete in itself; comp.
Philem. 1, Rom. xvi. 12 (comp. vv. 5,
8, 9), 3 Joh. 1. For the form compare
the expression in the Gospels, Matt.
iii. 17, etc. ὁ ὑίος μου, ὁ ἀγαπητός κ.τ.λ.;
where a comparison of Is. xlii. 1, as
quoted in Matt. xii. 18, seems to show
that ὁ ἀγαπητός κ.τ.λ. forms a distinct
clause from ὁ ὑίος μου.</p>

<p class='c034'>Δημᾶς] On the probability that this
person was a Thessalonian (2 Tim. iv.
10) and that his name was Demetrius,
see the introduction to the Epistles to
the Thessalonians. He appears in
close connexion with St Luke in Philem.
24, as here. In 2 Tim. iv. 10 their
conduct is placed in direct contrast,
Δημᾶς με ἐγκατέλιπεν ... Λοῦκας ἐστὶν μόνος
μετ’ ἐμοῦ. There is perhaps a foreshadowing
of this contrast in the language
here. While Luke is described
with special tenderness as ὁ ἰατρός, ὁ
ἀγαπητός, Demas alone is dismissed
with a bare mention and without any
epithet of commendation.</p>

etc.; see esp. Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>C. I.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> pp. 1072,

<p class='c034'>Those, who read αὐτῆς in the following
clause, take it as a woman’s

<p class='c034'>τὴν κατ’ οἶκον κ.τ.λ.] The same expression
is used of Prisca and Aquila
both at Rome (Rom. xvi. 5) and at
Ephesus (1 Cor. xvi. 19), and also of
Philemon, whether at Colossæ or at
Laodicea is somewhat uncertain (Philem. 2);

may be implied by the expressions

(de Rossi <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Roma Sotteranea</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span>

recognised by the Roman government
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘collegia’</span> or burial clubs, and protected
by this recognition doubtless
held their meetings for religious worship.
There is no clear example of a
separate building set apart for Christian
worship within the limits of the
Roman empire before the third century,
though apartments in private
houses might be specially devoted to
this purpose. This, I think, appears
as a negative result from the passages
collected in Bingham <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> <span class='fss'>I</span>. 13 and
Probst p. 181 sq. with a different view.
Hence the places of Christian assembly
were not commonly called ναοί till
quite late (Ignat. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Magn.</cite></span> 7 is not
really an exception), but οἶκοι Θεοῦ,
οἶκοι ἐκκλησιῶν, οἶκοι εὐκτήριοι, and the
like (Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> vii. 30, viii. 13,
ix. 9, etc.).</p>

<p class='c034'>αὐτῶν] The difficulty of this reading
has led to the two corrections, αὐτοῦ
and αὐτῆς, of which the former
appears in the received text and the
latter is supported by one or two very
ancient authorities. Of these alternative
readings however, αὐτοῦ is condemned
by its simplicity, and αὐτῆς
has arisen from the form Νυμφαν,
which <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prima facie</em></span> would look like a
woman’s name, and yet hardly can be
so. We should require to know more
of the circumstances to feel any confidence
in explaining αὐτῶν. A simple
explanation is that αὐτῶν denotes
‘Nymphas and his friends’, by a transition
which is common in classical
writers; e.g. Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Anab.</cite></span> iii. 3. 7 προσῄει

Or perhaps τοὺς ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ ἀδελφούς
may refer not to the whole body of the
Laodicean Church, but to a family of
Colossian Christians established in
Laodicea. Under any circumstances

)Ευρώπην διακομίσαιμεν. There are
good reasons for the belief that St
Paul here alludes to the so-called
Epistle to the Ephesians, which was
in fact a circular letter addressed to
the principal churches of proconsular
Asia (see above p. 37, and the introduction
to the Epistle to the Ephesians).
Tychicus was obliged to pass
through Laodicea on his way to Colossæ,
and would leave a copy there,
before the Colossian letter was delivered.
For other opinions respecting
this ‘letter from Laodicea’ see the
detached note.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἵνα καὶ ὑμεῖς κ.τ.λ.] ‘see <em>that ye also
read</em>’. At first sight it might seem as
though this ἵνα also were governed by
ποίησατε, like the former; but, inasmuch
as ποίησατε would be somewhat
awkward in this connexion, it is perhaps
better to treat the second clause as
independent and elliptical, (βλέπετἐ
ἵνα κ.τ.λ. This is suggested also by
the position of τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικίας before
ἵνα; comp. Gal. ii. 10 μόνον τῶν
πτωχῶν ἵνα μνημονεύωμεν (with the
note). Ellipses before ἵνα are frequent;
e.g. John ix. 3, 2 Cor. viii. 13,
2 Thess. iii. 9, 1 Joh. ii. 19.</p>

<p class='c034'>17. Κὰι )έιπατε] Why does not the
Apostle address himself directly to
Archippus? It might be answered that
he probably thought the warning
would come with greater emphasis,
when delivered by the voice of the
Church. Or the simpler explanation
perhaps is, that Archippus was not
resident at Colossæ but at Laodicea:
see the introduction to the Epistle
to Philemon. On this warning itself
see above, p. 42.</p>

<p class='c034'>Βλέπε] ‘<em>look to</em>’, as 2 Joh. 8 βλέπετε
ἑαυτοὺς ἵνα μὴ κ.τ.λ. More commonly
it has the accusative of the thing to
be avoided; see Phil. iii. 2 (with the
note).</p>

<p class='c034'>τὴν διακονίαν] From the stress which
is laid upon it, the διακονία here would
seem to refer, as in the case of Timothy
cited below, to some higher function
than the diaconate properly so
called. In Acts xii. 25 the same
phrase, πληροῦν τὴν διακονίαν, is used
of a temporary ministration, the collection
and conveyance of the alms for
the poor of Jerusalem (Acts xi. 29);
but the solemnity of the warning here
points to a continuous office, rather
than an immediate service.</p>

<p class='c034'>παρέλαβες] i.e. probably παρ’ ἐμοῦ.
The word suggests, though it does not
necessarily imply, a mediate rather
than a direct reception: see the note
Gal. i. 12. Archippus received the
charge immediately from St Paul,
though ultimately from Christ. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Non

<p class='c033'>18. ‘I add this salutation with my
own hand, signing it with my name
Paul. Be mindful of my bonds.
God’s grace be with you.’</p>

<p class='c034'>Ὁ ἀσπασμὸς κ.τ.λ.] The letter was
evidently written by an amanuensis
(comp. Rom. xvi. 22). The final salutation
alone, with the accompanying
sentence μνημονεύετε κ.τ.λ., was in the
Apostle’s own handwriting. This
seems to have been the Apostle’s
general practice, even where he does
not call attention to his own signature.
In 2 Thess. iii. 17 sq., 1 Cor. xvi. 21,
as here, he directs his readers’ notice
to the fact, but in other epistles he
is silent. In some cases however he
writes much more than the final sentence.
Thus the whole letter to
Philemon is apparently in his own
handwriting (see ver. 19), and in the
Epistle to the Galatians he writes a
long paragraph at the close (see the
note on vi. 11).</p>

<p class='c034'>τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ Παύλου] The same
phrase occurs in 2 Thess. iii. 17, 1 Cor.
xvi. 21. For the construction comp.
e.g. Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Leg. ad Cai.</cite></span> 8 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 554)
ἐμόν ἐστι τοῦ Μάκρωνος ἐργον Γάϊος,
and see Kühner § 406 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 242), Jelf
§ 467.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῶν δεσμῶν] His bonds establish
an additional claim to a hearing. He
who is suffering for Christ has a right
to speak on behalf of Christ. The
appeal is similar in Ephes. iii. 1 τούτου
χάριν ἐγὼ Παῦλος ὁ δέσμιος τοῦ Χ. Ἰ.,
which is resumed again (after a long
digression) in iv. 1 παρακαλῶ οὖν ὑμᾶς
ἐγὼ ὁ δέσμιος ἐν Κυρίῳ ἀξίως περιπατῆσαι
κ.τ.λ. (comp. vi. 20 ὑπὲρ ὁῦ
πρεσβεύω ἐν ἁλύσει). So too Philem.
9 τοιοῦτος ὢν ὡς Παῦλος ... δέσμιος
Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ. These passages seem
to show that the appeal here is not for
himself, but for his teaching—not for
sympathy with his sufferings but for
obedience to the Gospel. His bonds
were not his own; they were τὰ δεσμὰ
τοῦ εὐαγγελίου (Philem. 13). In Heb.
x. 34 the right reading is not τοῖς δεσμοῖς
μου, but τοῖς δεσμίοις συνεπαθήσατε
(comp. xiii. 3). Somewhat similar
is the appeal to his στίγματα in
Gal. vi. 17, ‘Henceforth let no man
trouble me.’ See the notes on Philem.
10, 13.</p>

<p class='c034'>Ἡ χάρις κ.τ.λ.] This very short form
of the final benediction appears only
here and in 1 Tim. vi. 21, 2 Tim. iv. 22.
In Tit. iii. 15 πάντων is inserted, and
so in Heb. xiii. 25. In Ephes. vi. 24
the form so far agrees with the examples
quoted, that ἡ χάρις is used
absolutely, though the end is lengthened
out. In all the earlier epistles ἡ
χάρις is defined by the addition of τοῦ
Κυρίου [ἡμῶν] Ἰησοῦ [Χριστοῦ]; 1 Thess.
v. 28, 2 Thess. iii. 18, 1 Cor. xvi. 23,
2 Cor. xiii. 13, Gal. vi. 18, Rom. xvi.
20, [24], Phil. iv. 23. Thus the absolute
ἡ χάρις in the final benediction
may be taken as a chronological note.
A similar phenomenon has been already
observed (τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις)

<div class='sidenote c015'>Harmonistic readings.</div>

<p class='c034'>In one respect the letters to the Ephesians and Colossians hold a unique
position among the Epistles of St Paul, as regards textual criticism. They
alone have been exposed, or exposed in any considerable degree, to those
harmonizing tendencies in transcribers, which have had so great an influence
on the text of the Synoptic Gospels.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Preponderant evidence (1) for the correct reading;</div>

<p class='c034'>In such cases there is sometimes no difficulty in ascertaining the correct
reading. The harmonistic change is condemned by the majority of the
oldest and best authorities; or there is at least a nearly even balance of external
testimony, and the suspicious character of the reading is quite sufficient
to turn the scale. Thus we cannot hesitate for a moment about such
readings as i. 14 διὰ τοῦ ἅιματος αὐτοῦ (from Ephes. i. 7), or iii. 16 ψαλμοῖς
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>καὶ</em>&nbsp; ὕμνοις &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>καὶ</em>&nbsp; ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς, and τῷ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>Κυρίῳ</em>&nbsp; (for τῷ Θεῷ) in the same

<p class='c034'>In other instances again there can hardly be any doubt about the text,

to test the worth of our authorities. Such examples are:</p>

is B. In D however they are written (though by the first hand) in smaller
letters and extend beyond the line (in both Greek and Latin), whence
we may infer that they were not found in a copy which was before the transcriber.
They are wanting also in the Thebaic Version and in one form of the
Æthiopic (Polyglott). They were also absent from copies used by Clement
of Alexandria (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pæd.</cite></span> iii. 11, p. 295, where however they are inserted
in the printed texts; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> iii. 5, p. 531), by Cyprian (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist.</cite></span> lv. 27, p. 645

though now found apparently in all the Latin <span class='fss'>MSS</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>iii. 21. ἐρεθίζετε.</div>

<p class='c034'>iii. 21. ἐρεθίζετε is only found in B K and in later hands of D (with its
transcript E) among the uncial <span class='fss'>MSS</span>. All the other uncials read παροργίζετε,
which is taken from Ephes. vi. 4. In this case however the reading of B is
supported by the greater number of cursives, and it accordingly has a place
in the received text. The versions (so far as we can safely infer their readings)
go almost entirely with the majority of uncials. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Syriac version misrepresented.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The true readings of
the Syriac Versions are just the reverse of those assigned to them even by
the chief critical editors, Tregelles and Tischendorf. Thus in the Peshito
the word used is the Aphel of
<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܪܓܙ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/rgz.jpg' alt='rgz' /></span>,
the same mood of the same verb being
employed to translate παροργίζειν, not only in Rom. x. 19, but even in
the parallel passage Ephes. vi. 4. The word in the text of the Harclean
is the same,
<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܬܪܓܛܙܘܢܢ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/trgtzwn.jpg' alt='trgtzwn' /></span>,

is given. White interprets this as saying that the text is ἐρεθίζετε and the
margin παροργίζετε, and he is followed by Tregelles and Tischendorf. But
in this version, as in the Peshito, the former word translates παροργίζειν in
Rom. x. 19, Ephes. vi. 4; while in the Peshito the latter word is adopted
to render ἐρεθίζειν in 2 Cor. ix. 2 (the only other passage in the N. T.
where ἐρεθίζειν occurs). In the Harclean of 2 Cor. ix. 2 a different word
from either,
<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܚܬܚܬ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/htht.jpg' alt='htht' /></span>,
is used. It seems tolerably clear therefore that
παροργίζετε was read in the text of both Peshito and Harclean here, while
ἐρεθίζετε was given in the margin of the latter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Latin versions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The Latin Versions seem

The Memphitic too has the same rendering <span lang="cop" xml:lang="cop">ϯϫωⲛτ</span> in both passages. Of
the earlier Greek fathers Clement, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Strom.</cite></span> iv. 8 (p. 593), reads ἐρεθίζετε:
and it is found in Chrysostom and some later writers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great value of B.</div>

<p class='c034'>These examples show how singularly free B is from this passion for
harmonizing, and may even embolden us to place reliance on its authority
in extreme cases.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parallel passages.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Col. iii. 16, Eph. v. 19.</div>

<p class='c034'>For instance, the parallel passages Ephes. v. 19 and Col. iii. 16 stand

Here are seven divergences from the received text. (1) The insertion of ἐν
before ψαλμοῖς in Ephes.; (2) The omission of καί, καί, attaching ψαλμοῖς,
ὕμνοις, ᾠδαῖς in Col.; (3) The omission of πνευματικαῖς in Ephes.; (4) The
insertion of τῇ before χάριτι in Col.; (5) The omission of ἐν before τῇ καρδίᾳ
in Ephes.; (6) The substitution of ταῖς καρδίαις for τῇ καρδίᾳ in Col.;
(7) The substitution of τῷ Θεῷ for τῷ Κυρίῳ in Col.</p>

<p class='c034'>Of these seven divergences the fourth alone does not affect the question:
of the remaining six, the readings of B in (2), (6), (7) are supported by the
great preponderance of the best authorities, and are unquestionably right.
In (1), (3), (5) however the case stands thus:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ἐν ψαλμοῖς.</div>

<p class='c024'>(1) ἐν ψαλμοῖς B, P, with the cursives 17, 67<sup>**</sup>, 73, 116, 118, and in
Latin, d, e, vulg., with the Latin commentators Victorinus, Hilary
and Jerome. Of these however it is clear that the Latin authorities
can have little weight in such a case, as the preposition
might have been introduced by the translator. All the other
Greek <span class='fss'>MSS</span> with several Greek fathers omit ἐν.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>πνευματικαῖς.</div>

<p class='c024'>(3) πνευματικαῖς omitted in B, d, e. Of the Ambrosian Hilary Tischendorf
says <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘fluct. lectio’</span>; but his comment <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘In quo enim est spiritus,
semper spiritualia meditatur’</span> seems certainly to recognise the
word. It appears to be found in every other authority.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>τῇ καρδίᾳ.</div>

<p class='c024'>(5) τῇ καρδίᾳ א<sup>*</sup> B with Origen in Cramer’s <cite>Catena</cite>, p. 201.</p>

<p class='c038'>ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ K L, and the vast majority of later <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, the Armenian
and Æthiopic Versions, Euthalius (Tischendorf’s <span class='fss'>MS</span>), Theodoret,
and others. The Harclean Syriac (text) is quoted by Tischendorf
and Tregelles in favour of ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ, but it is impossible
to say whether the translator had or had not the preposition.</p>

<p class='c038'>ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις א<sup>c</sup> A D F G P, 47, 8<sup>pe</sup>; the Old Latin, Vulgate, Memphitic,
Peshito Syriac, and Gothic Versions, together with the
margin of the Harclean Syriac; the fathers Basil (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 464),
Victorinus (probably), Theodore of Mopsuestia, the Ambrosian
Hilary, Jerome, and others. Chrysostom (as read in the existing
texts) wavers between ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ and ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις. This
form of the reading is an attempt to bring Ephes. into harmony
with Col., just as (6) is an attempt to bring Col. into harmony
with Ephes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen how slenderly B is supported; and yet we can hardly
resist the impression that it has the right reading in all three cases. In the
omission of πνευματικαῖς more especially, where the support is weakest, this
impression must, I think, be very strong.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Excellence of B elsewhere.</div>

<p class='c000'>This highly favourable estimate of B is our starting-point; and on the
whole it will be enhanced as we proceed. Thus for instance in i. 22 and ii. 2
we shall find this <span class='fss'>MS</span> alone (with one important Latin father) retaining the
correct text; in the latter case amidst a great complication of various readings.
And when again, as in iv. 8, we find B for once on the side of a reading
which might otherwise be suspected as a harmonistic change, this support
alone will weigh heavily in its favour. Other cases in which B (with more
or less support) preserves the correct reading against the mass of authorities
are ii. 2 πᾶν πλοῦτος, ii. 7 τῇ πίστει, ii. 13 τοῖς παραπτώμασιν (omitting ἐν),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>v. 12 σταθῆτε, together with several instances which will appear in the
course of the following investigation. On the other hand its value must
not be overestimated. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>False readings in B.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Thus in iv. 3 τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ δι’ ὃ καὶ
δέδεμαι<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c016'><sup>[536]</sup></a> there can be little doubt that the great majority of ancient authorities
correctly read δι’ ὅ, though B F G have δι’ ὅν: but the variation is
easily explained. A single stroke, whether accidental or deliberate, alone
would be necessary to turn the neuter into a masculine and make the
relative agree with the substantive nearest to it in position. Again in
ii. 10 ὅς ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλή, the reading of B which substitutes ὅ for ὅς is
plainly wrong, though supported in this instance by D F G 47<sup>*</sup>, by the Latin
text d, and by Hilary in one passage (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> ix. 8, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 263), though elsewhere
(ib. i. 13, <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 10) he reads ὅ. But here again we have only an instance
of a very common interchange. Whether for grammatical reasons or
from diplomatic confusion or from some other cause, five other instances of
this interchange occur in this short epistle alone; i. 15 ὅ for ὅς F G; i. 18 ὅ
for ὅς F G; i. 24 ὅς for ὅ C D<sup>*</sup> etc.; i. 27 ὅς for ὅ א C D K L etc.; iii. 14 ὅς
for ὅ א<sup>*</sup> D. Such readings again as the omission of καὶ αἰτούμενοι i. 9 by
B K, or of δι’ αὐτοῦ in i. 20 by B D<sup>*</sup> F G etc., or of ἡ ἐπιστολή in iv. 16 by
B alone, need not be considered, since the motive for the omission is
obvious, and the authority of B will not carry as great weight as it would
in other cases. Similarly the insertion of ἡ in i. 18, ἡ ἀρχή, by B, 47, 67<sup>**</sup>,
b<sup>scr</sup>, and of καί in ii. 15, καὶ ἐδειγμάτισεν, by B alone, do not appear to deserve
consideration, because in both instances these readings would suggest
themselves as obvious improvements. In other cases, as in the omission of
τῆς before γῆς (i. 20), and of ἑνί in ἐν ἑνί σώματι (iii. 15), the scribe of B has
erred as any scribe might err.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>The various readings in this epistle are more perplexing than perhaps
in any portion of St Paul’s Epistles of the same length. The following deserve
special consideration.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>i. 3  <span class="uncial">τῷ θεῷ πατρί.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>i. 3 τῷ θεῷ πατρί,]</div>

<p class='c000'>On this very unusual collocation I have already remarked in the notes
(p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>).  The authorities stand as follows:</p>

<p class='c039'>(1) τῷ θεῷ πατρί B C<sup>*</sup>.</p>

<p class='c039'>(2) τῷ θεῷ τῷ πατρί D<sup>*</sup> F G Chrysostom.</p>

<p class='c000'>One or other is also the reading of the Old Latin (d, e, g, harl.<sup>**</sup>), of the
Memphitic, the two Syriac (Peshito and Harclean), the Æthiopic, and the
Arabic (Erpenius, Bedwell, Leipzig) Versions; and of Augustine (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Unit.
Eccl.</cite></span> 45, <span class='fss'>IX.</span> p. 368) and Cassiodorus (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 1351, Migne).</p>

<p class='c040'>(3) τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρί א A C<sup>2</sup> D<sup>c</sup> K L P and apparently all the other
<span class='fss'>MSS</span>; the Vulgate and Armenian Versions; Euthalius (Tischendorf’s <span class='fss'>MS</span>),
Theodore of Mopsuestia (transl.), Theodoret, the Ambrosian Hilary, and
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>A comparison of these authorities seems to show pretty clearly that
τῷ θεῷ πατρί was the original reading. The other two were expedients
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>for getting rid of a very unusual collocation of words. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>compared with iii. 17,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The scribes have
felt the same difficulty again in iii. 17 εὐχαριστοῦντες τῷ θεῷ πατρὶ δι’
αὐτοῦ, and there again we find καί inserted before πατρί. In this latter
instance however the great preponderance of ancient authority is in
favour of the unusual form τῷ θεῷ πατρί.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and i. 12.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is worth observing also that in i. 12, where τῷ πατρί has the highest
support, there is sufficient authority for τῷ θεῷ πατρί to create a suspicion
that there too it may be possibly the correct reading. Thus τῷ θεῷ πατρί
is read in א 37, while θεῷ τῷ πατρί stands in F G. One or other must have
been the reading of some Old Latin and Vulgate texts (f, g, m, fuld.), of the
Peshito Syriac, of the Memphitic (in some texts; for others read τῷ πατρί
simply), of the Arabic (Bedwell), of the Armenian (Uscan), and of Origen
(<span class='fss'>II</span>. p. 451, the Latin translator); while several other authorities, Greek
and Latin, read τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρί.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Unique collocation.</div>

<p class='c000'>There is no other instance of this collocation of words, ὁ Θεὸς πατήρ,
in the Greek Testament, so far as I remember; and it must be regarded
as peculiar to this epistle.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>i. 4 <span class="uncial">τὴν ἀγάπην [ἣν ἔχετε]</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>i. 4 τὴν ἀγάπην [ἣν ἔχετε].</div>

<p class='c000'>Here the various readings are;</p>

<p class='c041'>(1) τὴν ἀγάπην B.</p>

<p class='c041'>(2) τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχετε A א C D<sup>*</sup> F G P 17, 37, 47; the Old
Latin and Vulgate, Memphitic (apparently), and Harclean
Syriac Versions; the Ambrosian Hilary, Theodore of
Mopsuestia (transl.), and others.</p>

<p class='c041'>(3) τὴν ἀγάπην τήν. D<sup>c</sup> K L; the Peshito Syriac (apparently),
and Armenian (apparently) Versions; Chrysostom, Theodoret
and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the question were to be decided by external authority alone, we
could not hesitate. It is important however to observe that (2) conforms
to the parallel passage Philem. 5 ἀκούων σου τὴν ἀγάπην καὶ τὴν πίστιν ἣν
ἔχεις, while (3) conforms to the other parallel passage Ephes. i. 15 καὶ [τὴν
ἀγάπην] τὴν εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἅγιους. Thus, though ἣν ἔχετε is so highly supported
and though it helps out the sense, it is open to suspicion. Still the
omission in B may be an instance of that impatience of apparently superfluous
words, which sometimes appears in this <span class='fss'>MS</span>.</p>

<p class='c042'>(1) ἡμῶν A B א<sup>*</sup> D<sup>*</sup> F G, 3, 13, 33, 43, 52, 80, 91, 109. This must
also have been the reading of the Ambrosian Hilary
(though the editors make him write <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘pro <em>vobis</em>’</span>), for he explains
it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘qui eis ministravit gratiam Christi <em>vice Apostoli</em>.’</span></p>

<p class='c042'>(2) ὑμῶν א<sup>c</sup> C D<sup>b</sup> K L P, 17, 37, 47, and many others; the Vulgate,
the Peshito and Harclean Syriac, the Memphitic,
Gothic, and Armenian Versions; Chrysostom, Theodore
of Mopsuestia (transl.), and Theodoret (in their respective
texts, for with the exception of Chrysostom there
is nothing decisive in their comments), with others.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>The Old Latin is doubtful; d, e having <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vobis</em></span> and g <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nobis</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the common confusion between these two words even in the
best <span class='fss'>MSS</span> is a caution against speaking with absolute certainty, yet such
a combination of the highest authorities as we have here for ἡμῶν does
not leave much room for doubt: and considerations of internal criticism
point in the same direction. See the note on the passage.</p>

we have</p>

<p class='c042'>(2) τῷ καλέσαντι D<sup>*</sup> F G, 17, 80, with the Latin authorities d, e,
f, g, m, and the Gothic, Armenian, and Æthiopic Versions.
It is so read also by the Ambrosian Hilary, by
Didymus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Trin.</cite></span> iii. 4 (p. 346), and by Vigilius Thapsensis
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Varim.</cite></span> i. 50 (p. 409).</p>

<p class='c042'>(3) τῷ καλέσαντι καὶ ἱκανώσαντι, found in B alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the confusion between <span class="uncial">τωιικανωϲαντι</span> and <span class="uncial">τωικαλεϲαντι</span> would
be easy, more especially at a period prior to the earliest existing <span class='fss'>MSS</span>,
when the iota adscript was still written; while at the same time καλέσαντι
would suggest itself to scribes as the obvious word in such a connexion. It
is a Western reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>The text of B obviously presents a combination of both readings.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>i. 14 <span class="uncial">ἐν ᾧ ἔχομεν</span>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>i. 14 ἔχομεν or ἔσχομεν?</div>

<p class='c000'>For ἔχομεν B, the Memphitic Version, and the Arabic (Bedwell, Leipzig),
read ἔσχομεν. This is possibly the correct reading. In the parallel passage,
Ephes. i. 7, several authorities (א<sup>*</sup> D<sup>*</sup>, the Memphitic and Æthiopic
Versions, and the translator of Irenæus v. 14. 3) similarly read ἔσχομεν for
ἔχομεν. It may be conjectured that ἔσχομεν in these authorities was a
harmonistic change in Ephes. i. 7, to conform to the text which they or
their predecessors had in Col. i. 14. Tischendorf on Ephes. l.c. says <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘aut
utroque loco εχομεν aut εσχομεν Paulum scripsisse puto’</span>; but if any inference
can be drawn from the phenomena of the <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, they point rather to a
different tense in the two passages.</p>

<p class='c000'>This reading is perhaps the highest testimony of all to the great value
of B.</p>

<p class='c000'>The variations are;</p>

<p class='c042'>(1) ἀποκατηλλάγητε B. This also seems to be the reading of
Hilary of Poitiers <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>In xci Psalm.</cite></span> 9 (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 270), who transfers
the Apostle’s language into the first person, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘cum

and others.</p>

<p class='c042'>(4) ἀποκατήλλαξεν, all the other authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these (2) is obviously a corruption of (1) from similarity of sound;
and (3) is an emendation, though a careless emendation, of (1) for the sake
of the grammar.  It should have been ἀποκαταλλαγέντας. The reading
therefore must lie between ἀποκατηλλάγητε and ἀποκατήλλαξεν. This latter
however is probably a grammatical correction to straighten the syntax.
In the Memphitic a single letter <span lang="cop" xml:lang="cop">ⲁϫ</span> for <span lang="cop" xml:lang="cop">ⲁϥ</span> would make the difference
between ἀποκατηλλάγητε and ἀποκατήλλαξεν; but no variation from the

<p class='c000'>The various readings here are very numerous and at first sight perplexing;

<p class='c000'>In this reading B stands alone among the <span class='fss'>MSS</span>; but it is supported by

however is invalidated by the fact that he uses <cite>et</cite> as the connecting
particle throughout the passage; and the Peshito Syriac also has ‘and’ for
ἤ in the two last clauses, though not in the second.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this same context it is probable that B retains the right form νεομηνίας

without the negative) as found in the Greek text: and Augustine
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist.</cite></span> 149, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 514), while giving the preference to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>quæ

<p class='c043'>(2) ἃ μὴ ἑώρακεν (ἑόρακεν) א<sup>c</sup> C D<sup>bc</sup> K L P, and the great majority of

<p class='c043'>(3) ἃ οὐκ ἑώρακεν F G.</p>

<p class='c000'>The negative is also read in g; in the Vulgate, the Gothic, both the
Syriac, and the Armenian Versions; in the translator of Origen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>In Rom.</cite></span> ix.

<p class='c000'>From a review of these authorities we infer that the insertion of the negative
was a later correction, and that ἃ ἕωρακεν (or ἕορακεν) represents the
prior reading. In my note I have expressed my suspicion that ἃ ἕωρακεν (or
ἕορακεν) is itself corrupt, and that the original reading is lost.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The form ἕορακεν.</div>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>ii. 23. Is καί to be omitted?</div>

<p class='c000'>Here καί is found in all the Greek copies except B, but is omitted in
these Latin authorities, m, the translator of Origen (<cite>In Rom.</cite> ix. § 42, <span class='fss'>IV.</span>
p. 665), Hilary of Poitiers (<cite>Tract. in xiv Ps.</cite> § 7, p. 73), the Ambrosian
Hilary, Ambrose (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>de Noe</cite></span> 25, p. 267), and Paulinus (<cite>Epist.</cite> 50, p. 292 sq.). We
have more than once found B and Hilary alone in supporting the correct
reading (i. 22, ii. 2); and this fact gives weight to their joint authority here.
The omission also seems to explain the impossible reading of d, e, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>have <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>in religione et humilitate sensus et vexationem corporis</em></span>, where for
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>et vexationem</em></span>, we should probably read <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ad vexationem</em></span>, as in the Ambrosian
Hilary. There was every temptation for a scribe to insert the καί so as to
make ἀφειδίᾳ range with the other datives: while on the other hand a finer
appreciation of the bearing of the passage suggests that St Paul would have
dissociated it, so as to give it a special prominence.</p>

<p class='c000'>A similar instance occurs in <a href='#III_12'>iii. 12</a> ὡς ἐκλεκτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἅγιοι καὶ ἠγαπημένοι,
where B omits the καί with 17 and the Thebaic Version<a class="c016" href='#f537'><sup>[537]</sup></a>. In 219
καὶ ἅγιοι is read for ἅγιοι καί. The great gain in force leads to the suspicion
that this omission may be correct, notwithstanding the enormous preponderance
of authority on the other side.</p>

is also the reading of א<sup>*</sup>, except that it has ὑμῶν for ἡμῶν.</p>

Chrysostom (expressly), and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The various readings accounted for.</div>

<p class='c000'>The internal evidence is considered in the note on the passage, and
found to accord with the vast preponderance of external authority in favour
of γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν. The reading of א by the first hand exhibits a
transitional stage. It would appear as though the transcriber intended it
to be read γνῷ τε τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν. At all events this is the reading of III
and of Io. Damasc. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Op.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 214. The variation γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν is thus
easily explained. (1) ἡμῶν would be accidentally substituted for ὑμῶν; (2) γνῶτε
would then be read γνῷ τε; (3) the awkward and superfluous τε would be
omitted. In illustration of the tendency to conform the persons of the
two verbs γνῷ, παρακαλέσῃ, (see p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>) it may be mentioned that 17 reads
γνῶτε, παρακαλέσητε, both here and in Ephes. vi. 22.</p>

<p class='c000'>The singular, whether αὐτοῦ or αὐτῆς, is the reading of the old Latin

in the Peshito and Harclean Syriac. In this language the same consonants
express masculine and feminine alike, the difference lying in the
pointing and vocalisation. And here the copies are inconsistent with themselves.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Syriac versions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In the Peshito (both the editio princeps and Schaaf) the proper

(without the point) = αὐτοῦ. The name
itself is written Nympha, which according to the transliteration of this version
might stand either for a masculine (as <em>Barnaba</em>, <em>Luka</em>, in the context, for
Βαρναβας, Λουκᾶς) or for a feminine (since <em>Demas</em>, <em>Epaphras</em>, are written with

So the commentator Hilary distinctly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be added that the word is accentuated as a masculine νυμφᾶν

<h3 id='pleroma' class='c019'><em>On the meaning of πλήρωμα.</em></h3>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c002'>The meaning of the verb πληροῦν.</div>

<p class='c000'>The verb πληροῦν has two senses. It signifies either (1) ‘To fill’, e.g.
Acts ii. 2 ἐπλήρωσεν ὅλον τὸν οἶκον; or (2) ‘To fulfil, complete, perfect,
accomplish’, e.g. Matt. xxvi. 56 ἵνα πληρωθῶσιν αἱ γραφαί, Rom. xiii. 8
νόμον πεπλήρωκεν, Acts xii. 25 πληρώσαντες τὴν διακονίαν. The latter sense
indeed is derived from the former, but practically it has become separate
from it. The word occurs altogether about a hundred times in the New
Testament, and for every one instance of the former sense there are at
least four of the latter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>False issue raised respecting πλήρωμα</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>resulting in theological confusion<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c000'>In the investigations which have hitherto been made into the signification
of the derived substantive πλήρωμα, as it occurs in the New Testament,
an almost exclusive prominence has been given to the former meaning
of the verb; and much confusion has arisen in consequence. The
question has been discussed whether πλήρωμα has an active or a passive
sense, whether it describes the filling substance or the filled receptacle:
and not unfrequently critics have arrived at the result that different
grammatical senses must be attached to it in different passages, even
within the limits of the same epistle. Thus it has been maintained that
the word has a passive sense <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘id quod impletur’</span> in Ephes. i. 23 τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ
ἥτις ἐστὶν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ τὰ πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν πληρουμένου,
and an active sense <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘id quod implet’</span> in Ephes. iii. 19 ἵνα πληρωθῆτε εἰς πᾶν
τὸ πληρώμα τοῦ Θεοῦ. Indeed so long as we see in πληροῦν only the sense
‘to fill’, and refuse to contemplate the sense ‘to complete’, it seems impossible
to escape from the difficulties which meet us at every turn, otherwise
than by assigning to its derivative πλήρωμα both an active and a
passive sense; but the greatest violence is thus done to the connexion of
theological ideas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and disregard of grammar.</div>

<p class='c000'>Moreover the disregard of lexical rules is not less violent<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c016'><sup>[540]</sup></a>. Substantives
in -μα, formed from the perfect passive, appear always to have a
passive sense. They may denote an abstract notion or a concrete thing;
they may signify the action itself regarded as complete, or the product of<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Meaning of substantives in -μα.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the action; but in any case they give the <em>result</em> of the agency involved in
the corresponding verb. Such for example are ἄγγελμα ‘a message’, ἅμμα
‘a knot’, ἀργύρωμα ‘a silver-made vessel’, βούλευμα ‘a plan’, δικαίωμα ‘a
righteous deed’ or ‘an ordinance’, ζήτημα ‘an investigation’, κήρυγμα ‘a
proclamation’, κώλυμα ‘a hindrance’, ὁμοίωμα ‘a likeness’, ὅραμα ‘a vision’,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>στρῶμα ‘a carpet’, σφαίρωμα ‘a round thing’, etc. In many cases the
same word will have two meanings, both however passive; it will denote
both the completed action and the result or object of the action: e.g.
ἅρπαγμα the ‘robbery’ or the ‘booty’, ἀντάλλαγμα the ‘exchange’ or the
‘thing given or taken in exchange’, θήρευμα the ‘hunt’ or the ‘prey’,
πάτημα the ‘tread’ or the ‘carpet’, and the like. But in all cases the word
is strictly passive; it describes that which might have stood after the
active verb, either as the direct object or as the cognate notion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Apparent exceptions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The
apparent exceptions are only apparent. Sometimes this deceptive appearance
is in the word itself. Thus κάλυμμα ‘a veil’ seems to denote ‘that
which <em>covers</em>’, but it is really derived from another sense and construction
of καλύπτειν, not ‘to hide’, but ‘to wrap round’ (e.g. Hom. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Il.</cite></span> v. 315 πρόσθε
δέ οἱ πέπλοιο φαεινοῦ πτύγμ’ ἐκάλυψεν, xxi. 321 τόσσην οἱ ἄσιν καθύπερθε
καλύψω), and therefore is strictly passive. Sometimes again we may be led
astray by the apparent connexion with the following genitive. Thus in
Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mor.</cite></span> 78 <span class='fss'>E</span> δήλωμα τοῦ προκόπτειν the word does not mean, as might
appear at first sight, ‘a thing showing’, but ‘a thing shown’, ‘a demonstration
given’; nor in 2 Thess. i. 5 ἐνδειγμα τῆς δικαίας κρίσεως must we
explain ἕνδειγμα ‘a thing proving’, but ‘a thing proved’, ‘a proof’. And
the same is probably the case also with such expressions as συμποσίων
ἐρέθισμα (Critias in Athen. xiii. p. 600 <span class='fss'>D</span>), τόξου ῥῦμα (Æsch. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pers.</cite></span> 147),
and the like; where the substantives in -μα are no more deprived of their
passive sense by the connexion, than they are in ὑπόδημα ποδῶν or στρῶμα
κλίνης; though in such instances the license of poetical construction may
often lead to a false inference. Analogous to this last class of cases is Eur.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Troad.</cite></span> 824 Ζηνὸς ἔχεις κυλίκων πλήρωμα καλλίσταν λατρείαν, not ‘the filling’,
but ‘the fulness of the cups, the brimming cups, of Zeus.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>πλήρωμα connected with the second sense of πληροῦν.]</div>

<p class='c000'>Now if we confine ourselves to the second of the two senses above
ascribed to πληροῦν, it seems possible to explain πλήρωμα in the same way,
at all events in all the theological passages of St Paul and St John, without
doing any violence to the grammatical form. As πληροῦν is ‘to complete’,
so πλήρωμα is ‘that which is completed’, i.e. the complement<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c016'><sup>[541]</sup></a>, the full
tale, the entire number or quantity, the plenitude, the perfection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its uses in Classical writers.</div>

<p class='c000'>This indeed is the primary sense to which its commonest usages in
classical Greek can be most conveniently referred. Thus it signifies (1)
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(1) ‘A ship’s crew.’<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘A ship’s crew’: e.g. Xen. <cite>Hell.</cite> i. 6. 16 διὰ τὸ ἐκ πολλῶν πληρωμάτων ἐς
ὀλίγας (ναῦς) ἐκλελέχθαι τοὺς ἀρίστους ἐρέτας. In this sense, which is very
frequent, it is generally explained as having an active force, ‘that which
fills the ships’; and this very obvious explanation is recommended by the
fact that πληροῦν ναῦν is a recognized expression for ‘manning a ship’, e.g.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Xen. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hell.</cite></span> i. 6. 24. But πλήρωμα is used not only of the crew which mans
a ship, but also of the ship which is manned with a crew; e.g. Polyb. i. 49.
4, 5 τὴν παρουσίαν τῶν πληρωμάτων ... τὰ προσφάτως παραγεγονότα πληρώματα,
Lucian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ver. Hist.</cite></span> ii. 37, 38, ἀπὸ δύο πληρωμάτων ἐμάχοντο ... πέντε γὰρ
εἶχον πληρώματα; and it is difficult to see how the word could be transferred
from the crew to the ship as a whole, if the common explanation
were correct. Fritzsche (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rom.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 469 sq.), to whom I am chiefly indebted
for the passages quoted in this paragraph, has boldly given the word two
directly opposite senses in the two cases, explaining it in the one <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ea quibus
naves complentur, <em>h. e.</em> vel socii navales vel milites classiarii vel utrique’</span>,
and in the other <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘id quod completur, <em>v. c.</em> navigium’</span>; but this severance of
meaning can hardly be maintained. On the other hand, if we suppose that
the crew is so called as ‘the complement,’ (i.e. ‘not that which fills the
ship,’ but ‘that which is itself full or complete in respect of the ship’),
we preserve the passive sense of the word, while at the same time the
transference to the fully equipped and manned vessel itself becomes natural.
In this sense ‘a complement’ we have the word used again of an army,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(2) ‘Population.’<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Aristid. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Or.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 381 μήτε αὐτάρκεις εσἔσθαι πλήρωμα ἑνὸς οἰκέιου στρατεύματος

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pol.</cite></span> iii. 13 (p. 1284) μὴ μέντοι δυνατοὶ πλήρωμα παρασχέσθαι πόλεως (comp.
iv. 4, p. 1291). Clearly the same idea of completeness underlies this
meaning of the word, so that here again it signifies ‘the complement’:
comp. Dion. Hal. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>A. R.</cite></span> vi. 51 τοῦ δ’ ὀλίγου καὶ οὐκ ἀξιομάχου πληρώματος

‘the whole body of his friends’. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(3) ‘Total amount.’<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(3) ‘The entire sum’, Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vesp.</cite></span> 660

total of nearly two thousand talents accrues to us’. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(4) ‘Entire term.’<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(4) ‘The full term’,
Herod. iii. 22 ὀγδώκοντα δ’ ἔτεα ζόης πλήρωμα ἀνδρὶ μακρότατον προκέεσθαι.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(5) ‘Fulfilment.’<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(5) ‘The perfect attainment’, ‘the full accomplishment’, e.g. Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Abr.</cite></span>
46 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 39) πλήρωμα χρηστῶν ἐλπίδων. In short the fundamental meaning
of the word generally, though perhaps not universally, is neither ‘the
filling material’, nor ‘the vessel filled’; but ‘that which is complete in
itself’, or in other words ‘plenitude, fulness, totality, abundance’.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Use of πλήρωμα in the Gospels.<br />Matt. ix. 16.</div>

<p class='c000'>In the Gospels the uses of the word present some difficulty. (1) In
Matt. ix. 16 αἴρει γὰρ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱματίου καὶ χεῖρον σχίσμα
γίνεται, it refers to the ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου which has gone before; but
πλήρωμα need not therefore be equivalent to ἐπίβλημα so as to mean the
patch itself, as is often assumed. The following pronoun αὐτοῦ is most
naturally referred to ἐπίβλημα; and if so πλήρωμα describes ‘the completeness’,
which results from the patch. The statement is thus thrown
into the form of a direct paradox, the very completeness making the
garment more imperfect than before. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mark ii. 21.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In the parallel passage Mark
ii. 21 the variations are numerous, but the right reading seems certainly
to be αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ κ.τ.λ. The received
text omits the preposition before αὐτοῦ, but a glance at the authorities is
convincing in favour of its insertion. In this case the construction will be
αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα (nom.) ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ (i.e. τοῦ ἱματίου, which has been mentioned
immediately before), τὸ καινὸν (πλήρωμἀ τοῦ παλαιοῦ (ἱματίοὐ;
‘The completeness takes away from the garment, the new <em>completeness</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of the old <em>garment</em>’, where the paradox is put still more emphatically.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mark vi. 43.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(2) In Mark vi. 43 the right reading is καὶ ἦραν κλασμάτων δώδεκα κοφίνους
πληρώματα, i.e. ‘full’ or ‘complete measures’, where the apposition to
κοφίνους obviates the temptation to explain πληρώματα as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ea quæ implent’</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mark viii. 20.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>On the other hand in Mark viii. 20 πόσων σπυρίδων πληρώματα
κλασμάτων ἤρατε; this would be the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>prima facie</em></span> explanation; comp.
Eccles. iv. 6 ἀγαθόν ἐστι πλήρωμα δρακὸς ἀναπαύσεως ὑπὲρ πληρώματα δύο
δρακῶν μόχθου. But it is objectionable to give an active sense to πλήρωμα
under any circumstances; and if in such passages the patch itself is meant,
it must still be so called, not because it fills the hole, but because it is
itself fulness or full measure as regards the defect which needs supplying.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Usage in St. Paul’s Epistles.</div>

<p class='c000'>From the Gospels we pass to the Epistles of St Paul, whose usage
bears more directly on our subject. And here the evidence seems all to
tend in the same direction. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1 Cor. x. 26.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(1) In 1 Cor. x. 26 τοῦ Κυρίου γὰρ ἡ γῆ καὶ τὸ
πλήρωμα αὐτῆς it occurs in a quotation from Ps. xxiv (xxiii). 1. The expressions
τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς γῆς, τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θαλάσσης, occur several times
in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> (e.g. Ps. xcvi (xcv). 11, Jer. viii. 16), where τὸ πλήρωμα is a
translation of <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">מלא</span>, a word denoting primarily ‘fulness’, but having in its
secondary uses a considerable latitude of meaning ranging between ‘contents’
and ‘abundance’. This last sense seems to predominate in its
Greek rendering πλήρωμα, and indeed the other is excluded altogether in
some passages, e.g. Cant. v. 13 ἐπὶ πληρώματα ὑδάτων. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rom. xiii. 10.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(2) In Rom. xiii. 10
πλήρωμα νόμου ἡ ἀγάπη, the best comment on the meaning of the word is
the context, ver. 8 ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὸν ἕτερον νόμον πεπλήρωκεν, so that πλήρωμα
here means the ‘completeness’ and so ‘fulfilment, accomplishment’: see
the note on Gal. v. 14. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rom. xv. 29.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(3) In Rom. xv. 29 ἐν πληρώματι εὐλογίας Χριστοῦ
ἐλεύσομαι, it plainly has the sense of ‘fulness, abundance’. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Gal. iv. 4.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(4) In Gal.
iv. 4 ὅτε δὲ ἦλθεν τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρονοῦ and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Eph. i. 10.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Ephes. i. 10 εἰς οἰκονομίαν τοῦ
πληρώματος τῶν καιρῶν, its force is illustrated by such passages as Mark
i. 15 πεπλήρωται ὁ καιρὸς καὶ ἤγγικεν ἡ βασιλεία κ.τ.λ., Luke xxi. 24 ἄχρι
οὗ πληρωθῶσιν καιροὶ ἐθνῶν (comp. Acts ii. 1, vii. 23, 30, ix. 23, xxiv. 27), so
that the expressions will mean ‘the full measure of the time, the full tale
of the seasons’. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rom. xi. 25.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(5) In Rom. xi. 25 πώρωσις ἀπὸ μέρους τῷ Ἰσραὴλ γέγονεν
ἄχρις ὁῦ τὸ πλήρωμα τῶν ἐθνῶν εἰσέλθῃ, it seems to mean ‘the full number’,
‘the whole body’, (whether the whole absolutely, or the whole relatively
to God’s purpose), of whom only a part had hitherto been gathered
into the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rom. xi. 12.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(6) In an earlier passage in this chapter the same
expression occurs of the Jews, xi. 12 εἰ δὲ τὸ παράπτωμα αὐτῶν πλοῦτος
κόσμου καὶ τὸ ἥττημα αὐτῶν πλοῦτος ἐθνῶν, πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῶν.
Here the antithesis between ἥττημα and πλήρωμα, ‘failure’ and ‘fulness’, is
not sufficiently direct to fix the sense of πλήρωμα; and (in the absence of
anything to guide us in the context) we may fairly assume that it is used
in the same sense of the Jews here, as of the Gentiles in ver. 25.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General result.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, whatever hesitation may be felt about the exact force of the
word as it occurs in the Gospels, yet substantially one meaning runs
through all the passages hitherto quoted from St Paul. In these πλήρωμα
has its proper passive force, as a derivative from πληροῦν ‘to make complete’.
It is ‘the full complement, the entire measure, the plenitude, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>fulness’. There is therefore a presumption in favour of this meaning in
other passages where it occurs in this Apostle’s writings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theological passages in</div>

<p class='c000'>We now come to those theological passages in the Epistles to the
Colossians and Ephesians and in the Gospel of St John, for the sake of
which this investigation has been undertaken. They are as follows;</p>

<p class='c000'>To these should be added two passages from the Ignatian Epistles<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c016'><sup>[542]</sup></a>,
which as belonging to the confines of the Apostolic age afford valuable
illustration of the Apostolic language.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The term has a recognised value</div>

<p class='c000'>It will be evident, I think, from the passages in St Paul, that the word
πλήρωμα ‘fulness, plenitude’, must have had a more or less definite theological
value when he wrote. This inference, which is suggested by the
frequency of the word, seems almost inevitable when we consider the form
of the expression in the first passage quoted, Col. i. 19. The absolute use
of the word, πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα ‘all <em>the</em> fulness’, would otherwise be unintelligible,
for it does not explain itself. In my notes I have taken ὁ Θεός to be
the nominative to εὐδόκησεν, but if the subject of the verb were πᾶν τὸ
πλήρωμα, as some suppose, the inference would be still more necessary. The
word however, regarded as a theological term, does not appear to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>adopted, like so many other expressions in the Apostolic writers<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c016'><sup>[544]</sup></a>, from the
nomenclature of Alexandrian Judaism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>derived from Palestine and not Alexandria.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>At least no instance of its occurrence
in this sense is produced from Philo. We may therefore conjecture
that it had a Palestinian origin, and that the Essene Judaizers of Colossæ,
whom St Paul is confronting, derived it from this source. In this case it
would represent the Hebrew <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">מלא</span>, of which it is a translation in the <span class='fss'>LXX</span>,
and the Aramaic
<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܡܘܠܙܐ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/mwlza.jpg' alt='mwlza' /></span>
or some other derivative of the same root,
such being its common rendering in the Peshito.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>It denotes the totality of the Divine powers, etc. in the Colossian letter.</div>

<p class='c000'>The sense in which St Paul employs this term was doubtless the sense
which he found already attached to it. He means, as he explicitly states in
the second Christological passage of the Colossian Epistle (ii. 9), the pleroma,
the plenitude of ‘the Godhead’ or ‘of Deity’. In the first passage
(i. 19), though the word stands without the addition τῆς θεότητος, the signification
required by the context is the same. The true doctrine of the one
Christ, who is the absolute mediator in the creation and government of the
world, is opposed to the false doctrine of a plurality of mediators, ‘thrones,
dominions, principalities, powers’. An absolute and unique position is
claimed for Him, because in Him resides ‘all the pleroma’, i.e. the full
complement, the aggregate of the Divine attributes, virtues, energies. This
is another way of expressing the fact that He is the Logos, for the Logos is
the synthesis of all the various δυνάμεις, in and by which God manifests
Himself whether in the kingdom of nature or in the kingdom of grace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Analogy to its usage elsewhere: e.g.</div>

<p class='c000'>This application is in entire harmony with the fundamental meaning of
the word. The term has been transferred to the region of theology, but in
itself it conveys exactly the same idea as before. It implies that all the
several elements which are required to realise the conception specified are
present, and that each appears in its full proportions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>in Philo of the family<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Thus Philo, describing
the ideal state of prosperity which will result from absolute obedience
to God’s law, mentions among other blessings the perfect development of
the family: ‘Men shall be fathers and fathers too of goodly sons, and women
shall be mothers of goodly children, so that each household shall be the
<em>pleroma</em> of a numerous kindred, where no part or name is wanting of all
those which are used to designate relations, whether in the ascending line,
as parents, uncles, grandfathers, or again in the descending line in like
manner, as brothers, nephews, sons’ sons, daughters’ sons, cousins, cousins’
sons, kinsmen of all degrees<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c016'><sup>[545]</sup></a>.’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and in Aristotle, of the state.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>So again Aristotle, criticizing the <cite>Republic</cite>
of Plato, writes; ‘Socrates says that a city (or state) is composed of
four classes, as its indispensable elements (τῶν ἀναγκαιοτάτων): by these he
means the weaver, the husbandman, the shoemaker, and the builder; and
again, because these are not sufficient by themselves, he adds the smith
and persons to look after the necessary cattle, and besides them the merchant
and the retail dealer: these together make up the <em>pleroma</em> of a
city in its simplest form (ταῦτα πάντα γίνεται πλήρωμα τῆς πρώτης πόλεως);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>thus he assumes that a city is formed to supply the bare necessities of life
(τῶν ἀναγκων χάριν) etc.’<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c016'><sup>[546]</sup></a>. From these passages it will be seen that the
adequacy implied by the word, as so used, consists not less in the variety
of the elements than in the fulness of the entire quantity or number.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Transition from Colossians to Ephesians.</div>

<p class='c000'>So far the explanation seems clear. But when we turn from the Colossian
letter to the Ephesian, it is necessary to bear in mind the different
aims of the two epistles. While in the former the Apostle’s main object
is to assert the supremacy of the Person of Christ, in the latter his principal
theme is the life and energy of the Church, as dependent on Christ<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c016'><sup>[547]</sup></a>.
So the pleroma residing in Christ is viewed from a different aspect, no
longer in relation to God, so much as in relation to the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Corresponding application of πληρωμα to the Church.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>It is that
plenitude of Divine graces and virtues which is communicated through
Christ to the Church as His body. The Church, as <em>ideally</em> regarded, the
bride ‘without spot or wrinkle or any such thing’, becomes in a manner
identified with Him<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c016'><sup>[548]</sup></a>. All the Divine graces which reside in Him are
imparted to her; His ‘fulness’ is communicated to her: and thus she may
be said to be His pleroma (i. 23). This is the ideal Church. The actual
militant Church must be ever advancing, ever struggling towards the
attainment of this ideal. Hence the Apostle describes the end of all
offices and administrations in the Church to be that the collective body
may attain its full and mature growth, or (in other words) may grow up
to the complete stature of Christ’s fulness<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c016'><sup>[549]</sup></a>. But Christ’s fulness is God’s
fulness. Hence in another passage he prays that the brethren may by
the indwelling of Christ be fulfilled till they attain to the <em>pleroma</em> of God
(iii. 19). It is another way of expressing the continuous aspiration and
effort after holiness which is enjoined in our Lord’s precept, ‘Ye shall
be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect’<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c016'><sup>[550]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gospel of St. John.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Gospel of St John, written in the first instance for the same
Churches to which the Epistle to the Ephesians was sent, has numerous and
striking points of resemblance with St Paul’s letter. This is the case here.
As St Paul tells the Ephesians that the ideal Church is the pleroma of
Christ and that the militant Church must strive to become the pleroma
of Christ, so St John (i. 14 sq.) after describing our Lord as μονογενής,
i.e. the unique and absolute representative of the Father, and as such
‘full (πλήρης) of grace and of truth’, says that they, the disciples, had
‘received out of His pleroma’ ever fresh accessions of grace. Each individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>believer in his degree receives a fraction of that pleroma which is
communicated whole to the ideal Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ignatian letters.</div>

<p class='c000'>The use of the word is not very different in the Ignatian letters. St
Ignatius greets this same Ephesian Church, to which St Paul and St John
successively here addressed the language already quoted, as ‘blessed in
greatness by the pleroma of God the Father,’ i.e. by graces imparted
from the pleroma. To the Trallians again he sends a greeting ‘in the pleroma’,
where the word denotes the sphere of Divine gifts and operations, so
that ἐν τῷ πληρώματι is almost equivalent to ἐν τῷ Κυρίῳ or ἐν τῷ πνεύματι.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gnostic sects.</div>

<p class='c000'>When we turn from Catholic Christianity to the Gnostic sects we find
this term used, though (with one important exception) not in great frequency.
Probably however, if the writings of the earlier Gnostics had
been preserved, we should have found that it occupied a more important
place than at present appears. One class of early Gnostics separated the
spiritual being Christ from the man Jesus; they supposed that the Christ
entered Jesus at the time of His baptism and left him at the moment of
His crucifixion. Thus the Christ was neither born as a man nor suffered
as a man. In this way they obviated the difficulty, insuperable to the
Gnostic mind, of conceiving the connexion between the highest spiritual
agency and gross corporeal matter which was involved in the
Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation and Passion, and which Gnostics of
another type more effectually set aside by the theory of docetism, i.e. by
assuming that the human body of our Lord was only a phantom body and
not real flesh and blood. Irenæus represents the former class as teaching
that ‘Jesus was the receptacle of the Christ’, and that the Christ ‘descended
upon him from heaven in the form of a dove and after He had
declared (to mankind) the nameless Father, entered (again) into the pleroma
imperceptibly and invisibly’<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c016'><sup>[551]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Cerinthians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Here no names are given. But in
another passage he ascribes precisely the same doctrine, without however
naming the pleroma, to Cerinthus<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c016'><sup>[552]</sup></a>. And in a third passage, which links
together the other two, this same father, after mentioning this heresiarch,
again alludes to the doctrine which maintained that the Christ, having
descended on Jesus at his baptism, ‘flew back again into His own pleroma’<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c016'><sup>[553]</sup></a>.
In this last passage indeed the opinions of Cerinthus are mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>in connexion with those of other Gnostics, more especially the
Valentinians, so that we cannot with any certainty attribute this expression
to Cerinthus himself. But in the first passage the unnamed heretics who
maintained this return of the Christ ‘into the pleroma’ are expressly distinguished
from the Valentinians; and presumably therefore the allusion
is to the Cerinthians, to whom the doctrine, though not the expression, is
ascribed in the second passage. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Connexion of this use with St Paul and with the Colossian heretics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Thus there seems to be sufficient reason
for attributing the use of the term to Cerinthus<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c016'><sup>[554]</sup></a>. This indeed is probable
on other grounds. The term <em>pleroma</em>, we may presume, was common to
St Paul and the Colossian heretics whom he controverts. To both alike it
conveyed the same idea, the totality of the divine powers or attributes or
agencies or manifestations. But after this the divergence begins. They
maintained that a single divine power, a fraction of the pleroma, resided in
our Lord: the Apostle urges on the contrary, that the whole pleroma has
its abode in Him<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c016'><sup>[555]</sup></a>. The doctrine of Cerinthus was a development of the
Colossian heresy, as I have endeavoured to show above<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c016'><sup>[556]</sup></a>. He would
therefore inherit the term <em>pleroma</em> from it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The <em>pleroma</em> localized.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>At the same time he
seems to have given a poetical colouring to his doctrine, and so doing
to have treated the pleroma as a <em>locality</em>, a higher spiritual region,
from which this divine power, typified by the dove-like form, issued
forth as on wings, and to which, taking flight again, it reascended
before the Passion. If so, his language would prepare the way for the still
more elaborate poetic imagery of the Valentinians, in which the pleroma,
conceived as a locality, a region, an <em>abode</em> of the divine powers, is conspicuous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The term avoided by Basilides,</div>

<p class='c000'>The attitude of later Gnostics towards this term is widely divergent.
The word is not, so far as I am aware, once mentioned in connexion with
the system of Basilides. Indeed the nomenclature of this heresiarch belongs
to a wholly different type; and, as he altogether repudiated the
doctrine of emanations<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c016'><sup>[557]</sup></a>, it is not probable that he would have any fondness
for a term which was almost inextricably entangled with this doctrine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>but prominent in Valentinianism.</div>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand with Valentinus and the Valentinians the doctrine
of the <em>pleroma</em> was the very key-stone of their system; and, since at first
sight it is somewhat difficult to connect their use of the term with St Paul’s,
a few words on this subject may not be out of place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Poetic teaching of Valentinus.</div>

<p class='c000'>Valentinus then dressed his system in a poetic imagery not unlike the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>myths of his master Plato. But a myth or story involves action, and action
requires a scene of action. Hence the mysteries of theology and cosmogony
and redemption call for a <em>topographical</em> representation, and the pleroma
appears not as an abstract idea, but as a locality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Topographical</em> conception of the pleroma.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Valentinian system accordingly maps out the universe of things
into two great regions, called respectively the <em>pleroma</em> and the <em>kenoma</em>,
the ‘fulness’ and the ‘void’. From a Christian point of view these may be
described as the kingdoms of light and of darkness respectively. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Antithesis of <em>pleroma</em> and <em>kenoma</em>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>From
the side of Platonism, they are the regions of real and of phenomenal
existences—the world of eternal archetypes or ideas, and the world of
material and sensible things. The identification of these two antitheses
was rendered easy for the Gnostic; because with him knowledge was one
with morality and with salvation, and because also matter was absolutely
bound up with evil. It is difficult to say whether the Platonism or the
Christianity predominates in the Valentinian theology; but the former at
all events is especially prominent in their conception of the relations
between the pleroma and the kenoma.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Pleroma</em> the abode of the Æons.</div>

<p class='c000'>The pleroma is the abode of the Æons, who are thirty in number.
These Æons are successive emanations, of which the first pair sprang immediately
from the preexistent Bythus or Depth. This Bythus is deity in
itself, the absolute first principle, as the name suggests; the profound,
unfathomable, limitless, of whom or of which nothing can be predicated
and nothing known. Here again we have something like a <em>local</em> representation.
The Æons or emanations are plainly the attributes and energies
of deity; they are, or they comprise, the eternal ideas or archetypes of the
Platonic philosophy. In short they are deity relative, deity under self-imposed
limitations, deity derived and divided up, as it were, so as at
length to be conceivable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Different forms of Valentinianism.</div>

<p class='c000'>The topographical relation of Bythus to the derived Æons was differently
given in different developments of the Valentinian teaching.
According to one representation he was outside the pleroma; others
placed his abode within it, but even in this case he was separated from the
rest by Horus (Ὅρος), a personified Boundary or Fence, whom none, not
even the Æons themselves, could pass<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c016'><sup>[558]</sup></a>. The former mode of representation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>might be thought to accord better with the imagery, at the same time
that it is more accurate if regarded as the embodiment of a philosophical
conception. Nevertheless the latter was the favourite mode of delineation;
and it had at least this recommendation, that it combined in one all
that is real, as opposed to all that is phenomenal. In this pleroma every
existence which is suprasensual and therefore true has its abode.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Kenoma</em>, the region of phenomena.</div>

<p class='c000'>Separated from this celestial region by Horus, another Horus or
Boundary, which, or who, like the former is impassable, lies the ‘kenoma’
or ‘void’—the kingdom of this world, the region of matter and material
things, the land of shadow and darkness<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c016'><sup>[559]</sup></a>. Here is the empire of the
Demiurge or Creator, who is not a celestial Æon at all, but was born in this
very void over which he reigns. Here reside all those phenomenal, deceptive,
transitory things, of which the eternal counterparts are found only in
the pleroma.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Platonism of this antithesis.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is in this antithesis that the Platonism of the Valentinian theory
reaches its climax. All things are set off one against another in these two
regions<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c016'><sup>[560]</sup></a>: just as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

      <div class='line'>Floats double, swan and shadow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not only have the thirty Æons their terrestrial counterparts; but their
subdivisions also are represented in this lower region. The kenoma too
has its ogdoad, its decad, its dodecad, like the pleroma<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c016'><sup>[561]</sup></a>. There is one
Sophia in the supramundane region, and another in the mundane; there
is one Christ who redeems the Æons in the spiritual world, and a second
Christ who redeems mankind, or rather a portion of mankind, in the
sensible world. There is an Æon Man and another Æon Ecclesia in the
celestial kingdom, the ideal counterparts to the Human Race and the
Christian Church of the terrestrial. Even individual men and women, as
we shall see presently, have their archetypes in this higher sphere of
intelligible being.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The localization of the <em>pleroma</em> carried out in detail.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The topographical conception of the pleroma moreover is carried out
in the details of the imagery. The second Sophia, called also Achamoth, is
the desire, the offspring, of her elder namesake, separated from her
mother, cast out of the pleroma, and left ‘stranded’ in the void beyond<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c016'><sup>[562]</sup></a>,
being prevented from returning by the inexorable Horus who guards the
frontier of the supramundane kingdom. The second Christ—a being compounded
of elements contributed by all the Æons<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c016'><sup>[563]</sup></a>—was sent down from the
pleroma, first of all at the eve of creation to infuse something like order
and to provide for a spiritual element in this lower world; and secondly,
when He united Himself with the man Jesus for the sake of redeeming
those who were capable of redemption<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c016'><sup>[564]</sup></a>. At the end of all things Sophia
Achamoth, and with her the spiritual portion of mankind, shall be redeemed
and received up into the pleroma, while the psychical portion will be left
outside to form another kingdom under the dominion of their father the
Demiurge. This redemption and ascension of Achamoth (by a perversion of
a scriptural image) was represented as her espousals with the Saviour, the
second Christ; and the pleroma, the scene of this happy union, was called
the bridal-chamber<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c016'><sup>[565]</sup></a>. Indeed the localization of the pleroma is as complete
as language can make it. The constant repetition of the words ‘within’
and ‘without’, ‘above’ and ‘beneath’, in the development of this philosophical
and religious myth still further impresses this local sense on the term<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c016'><sup>[566]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The connexion with St. Paul’s use of the term obscured,</div>

<p class='c000'>In this topographical representation the connexion of meaning in the
word <em>pleroma</em> as employed by St Paul and by Valentinus respectively
seems at first sight to be entirely lost. When we read of the contrast between
the pleroma and the kenoma, the fulness and the void, we are
naturally reminded of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>plenum</em></span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vacuum</em></span> of physical speculations.
The sense of pleroma, as expressing completeness and so denoting
the aggregate or totality of the Divine powers, seems altogether to have
disappeared. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>owing partly to the false antithesis κένωμα<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But in fact this antithesis of κένωμα was, so far as we can
make out, a mere after-thought, and appears to have been borrowed, as
Irenæus states, from the physical theories of Democritus and Epicurus<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c016'><sup>[567]</sup></a>.
It would naturally suggest itself both because the opposition of πλήρης and
κενὸς was obvious, and because the word κένωμα materially assisted the
imagery as a description of the kingdom of waste and shadow. But in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>itself it is a false antithesis. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>borrowed from physical philosophers;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The true antithesis appears in another, and
probably an earlier, term used to describe the mundane kingdom. In this
earlier representation, which there is good reason for ascribing to Valentinus
himself, it is called not κένωμα ‘the void’, but ὑστέρημα ‘the deficiency,
incompleteness’<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c016'><sup>[568]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>but reappears in their common phraseology.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Moreover the common phraseology of the
Valentinian schools shows that the idea suggested by this opposition to
κένωμα was not the original idea of the term. They speak of τὸ πλήρωμα
τῶν  αἴωνων, τὸ πᾶν πλήρωμα τῶν  αἴωνων, ‘the whole aggregate of the
Æons’<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c016'><sup>[569]</sup></a>. And this (making allowance for the personification of the Æons)
corresponds exactly to its use in St Paul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The original meaning shown by other uses.</div>

<p class='c000'>Again the teaching of the Valentinian schools supplies other uses
which serve to illustrate its meaning. Not only does the supramundane
kingdom as a whole bear this name, but each separate Æon, of which that
kingdom is the aggregation, is likewise called a pleroma<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c016'><sup>[570]</sup></a>. This designation
is given to an Æon, because it is the fulness, the perfection, of which
its mundane counterpart is only a shadowy and defective copy. Nor does
the narrowing of the term stop here. There likewise dwells in this higher
region a pleroma, or eternal archetype, not only of every comprehensive
mundane power, but of each individual man; and to wed himself with this
heavenly partner, this Divine ideal of himself, must be the study of his life.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Interpretation of John iv. 17, 18.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The profound moral significance, which underlies the exaggerated Platonism
and perverse exegesis of this conception, will be at once apparent.
But the manner in which the theory was carried out is curiously illustrated
by the commentary of the Valentinian Heracleon on our Lord’s
discourse with the Samaritan woman<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c016'><sup>[571]</sup></a>. This woman, such is his explanation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>belongs to the spiritual portion of mankind. But she had had six<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c016'><sup>[572]</sup></a>
husbands, or in other words she had entangled herself with the material
world, had defiled herself with sensuous things. The husband however,
whom she now has, is not her husband; herein she has spoken rightly: the
Saviour in fact means ‘her partner from the pleroma’. Hence she is
bidden to go and call him; that is, she must find ‘her pleroma, that
coming to the Saviour with him (or it), she may be able to obtain from
Him the power and the union and the combination with her pleroma’ (τὴν
δύναμιν καὶ τὴν ἕνωσιν καὶ τὴν ἀνάκρασιν τὴν πρὸς τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς). ‘For’,
adds Heracleon, ‘He did not speak of a mundane (κοσμικοῦ) husband when
He told her to call him, since He was not ignorant that she had no lawful
husband’.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Valentinians accept St Paul and St John,</div>

<p class='c000'>Impossible as it seems to us to reconcile the Valentinian system with
the teaching of the Apostles, the Valentinians themselves felt no such
difficulty. They intended their philosophy not to supersede or contradict
the Apostolic doctrine, but to supplement it and to explain it on philosophical
principles. Hence the Canon of the Valentinians comprehended
the Canon of Catholic Christianity in all its essential parts, though some
Valentinian schools at all events supplemented it with Apocryphal writings.
More particularly the Gospel of St John and the Epistles to the
Colossians and Ephesians were regarded with especial favour; and those
passages which speak of the pleroma are quoted more than once in their
writings to illustrate their teaching. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and quote them in support of their views.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>By isolating a few words from the
context and interpreting them wholly without reference to their setting,
they had no difficulty in finding a confirmation of their views, where we see
only an incongruity or even a contradiction. For instance, their second
Christ—the redeemer of the spiritual element in the mundane world—was,
as we saw, compacted of gifts contributed by all the Æons of the pleroma.
Hence he was called ‘the common fruit of the pleroma’, ‘the fruit of all the
pleroma’<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c016'><sup>[573]</sup></a>, ‘the most perfect beauty and constellation of the pleroma’<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c016'><sup>[574]</sup></a>; hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>also he was designated ‘All’ (πᾶν) and ‘All things’ (πάντα)<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c016'><sup>[575]</sup></a>. Accordingly,
to this second Christ, not to the first, they applied these texts; Col. iii. 11
‘And He is all things’, Rom. xi. 36 ‘All things are unto Him and from Him
are all things’, Col. ii. 9 ‘In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead’,
Ephes. i. 10 ‘To gather together in one all things in Christ through God’<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c016'><sup>[576]</sup></a>.
So too they styled him )Ευδόκητος, with a reference to Col. i. 19, because
‘all the pleroma was pleased through Him to glorify the Father’<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c016'><sup>[577]</sup></a>. And
inasmuch as this second Christ was according to the Valentinian theory
instrumental in the creation of the mundane powers, they quoted, or rather
misquoted, as referring to this participation in the work of the Demiurge,
the passage Col. i. 16 ‘In Him were created all things, visible and invisible,
thrones, deities, dominions’<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c016'><sup>[578]</sup></a>. Indeed it seems clear that these adaptations
were not always afterthoughts, but that in several instances at least their
nomenclature was originally chosen for the sake of fitting the theory to
isolated phrases and expressions in the Apostolic writings, however much
it might conflict with the Apostolic doctrine in its main lines<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c016'><sup>[579]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Use of the term by the Docetæ</div>

<p class='c000'>The heretics called Docetæ by Hippolytus have no connexion with
docetism, as it is generally understood, i.e. the tenet that Christ’s body
was not real flesh and blood, but merely a phantom body. Their views on
this point, as represented by this father, are wholly different<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c016'><sup>[580]</sup></a>. Of their
system generally nothing need be said here, except that it is largely saturated
with Valentinian ideas and phrases. From the Valentinians they
evidently borrowed their conception of the pleroma, by which they understood
the aggregate, or (as localized) the abode, of the Æons. With them,
as with the Valentinians, the Saviour is the common product of all the
Æons<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c016'><sup>[581]</sup></a>; and in speaking of him they echo a common Valentinian phrase
‘the pleroma of the entire Æons’<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c016'><sup>[582]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>and by two Ophite sects.</div>

<p class='c000'>The Ophite heresy, Proteus-like, assumes so many various forms, that
the skill of critics has been taxed to the utmost to bind it with cords
and extract its story from it. It appears however from the notices of
Hippolytus, that the term <em>pleroma</em> was used in a definite theological sense
by at least two branches of the sect, whom he calls Naassenes and Peratæ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) Naassenes.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the Naassenes Hippolytus tells us that among other images borrowed
from the Christian and Jewish Scriptures, as well as from heathen
poetry, they described the region of true knowledge—their kingdom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>heaven, which was entered by initiation into their mysteries—as the land
flowing with milk and honey, ‘which when the perfect (the true Gnostics,
the fully initiated) have tasted, they are freed from subjection to kings (ἀβασιλεύτους)
and partake of the pleroma.’ Here is a plain allusion to Joh.
i. 16. ‘This’, the anonymous Naassene writer goes on to say, ‘is the pleroma,
through which all created things coming into being are produced
and fulfilled (πεπλήρωται) from the Uncreated’<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c016'><sup>[583]</sup></a>. Here again, as in the
Valentinian system, the conception of the pleroma is strongly tinged with
Platonism. The pleroma is the region of ideas, of archetypes, which
intervenes between the author of creation and the material world, and
communicates their specific forms to the phenomenal existences of the
latter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) Peratæ.</div>

<p class='c000'>The theology of the second Ophite sect, the Peratæ, as described by
Hippolytus, is a strange phenomenon. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Their theology<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>They divided the universe into
three regions, the uncreate, the self-create, and the created. Again the
middle region may be said to correspond roughly to the Platonic kingdom
of ideas. But their conception of deity is entirely their own. They
postulate three of every being; three Gods, three Words, three Minds
(i.e. as we may suppose three Spirits), three Men. Thus there is a God
for each region, just as there is a Man. In full accordance with this perverse
and abnormal theology is their application of St Paul’s language.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and corresponding application of πλήρωμα.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Their Christ has three natures, belonging to these three kingdoms respectively;
and this completeness of His being is implied by St Paul in Col.
i. 19, ii. 9, which passages are combined in their loose quotation or paraphrase,
‘All the pleroma was pleased to dwell in him bodily, and there is
in him all the godhead’, i.e. (as Hippolytus adds in explanation) ‘of this
their triple division (τῆς οὕτω διῃρημένης τρίαδος)’<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c016'><sup>[584]</sup></a>. This application is
altogether arbitrary, having no relation whatever to the theological meaning
of the term in St Paul. It is also an entire departure from the
conception of the Cerinthians, Valentinians, and Naassenes, in which this
meaning, however obscured, was not altogether lost. These three heresies
took a horizontal section of the universe, so to speak, and applied the
term as coextensive with the supramundane stratum. The Peratæ on the
other hand divided it vertically, and the pleroma, in their interpretation of
the text, denoted the whole extent of this vertical section. There is
nothing in common between the two applications beyond the fundamental
meaning of the word, ‘completeness, totality’.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pistis Sophia.</div>

<p class='c000'>The extant Gnostic work, called Pistis Sophia, was attributed at one
time on insufficient grounds to Valentinus. It appears however to
exhibit a late development of Ophitism<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c016'><sup>[585]</sup></a>, far more Christian and less
heathen in its character than those already considered. In this work the
word pleroma occurs with tolerable frequency; but its meaning is not
easily fixed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Frequent use of the term.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Early in the treatise it is said that the disciples supposed a
certain ‘mystery’, of which Jesus spoke, to be ‘the end of all the ends’
and ‘the head (κεφαλήν) of the Universe’ and ‘the whole pleroma’<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c016'><sup>[586]</sup></a>.
Here we seem to have an allusion to the Platonic kingdom of ideas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>i.e. of intelligible being, of absolute truth, as reproduced in the Valentinian
pleroma. And the word is used sometimes in connexion with the
completeness of revelation or the perfection of knowledge. Thus our
Lord is represented as saying to His disciples, ‘I will tell you the whole
mystery and the whole pleroma, and I will conceal nothing from you
from this hour; and in perfection will I perfect you in every pleroma and
in every perfection and in every mystery, which things are the perfection of
all the perfections and the pleroma of all the pleromas’<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c016'><sup>[587]</sup></a>. Elsewhere
however Mary, to whom Jesus is represented as making some of his
chief revelations, is thus addressed by Him; ‘Blessed art thou above
(παρὰ) all women that are on the earth, for thou shalt be pleroma of all
the pleromas and perfection of all the perfections’<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c016'><sup>[588]</sup></a>, where the word must
be used in a more general sense.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Monoimus the Arabian.</div>

<p class='c000'>One heresy still remains to be noticed in connexion with this word.
Hippolytus has preserved an account of the teaching of Monoimus the
Arabian, of whom previously to the discovery of this father’s treatise we
knew little more than the name. In this strange form of heresy the
absolute first principle is the uncreate, imperishable, eternal Man. I need
not stop to enquire what this statement means. It is sufficient for the
present purpose to add that this eternal Man is symbolized by the letter Ι,
the ‘one iota’, the ‘one tittle’ of the Gospel<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c016'><sup>[589]</sup></a>; and this Ι, as representing
the number ten, includes in itself all the units from one to nine. ‘This’,
added Monoimus, ‘is (meant by) the saying (of scripture) <em>All the pleroma
was pleased to dwell upon the Son of Man</em> <em>bodily</em>’<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c016'><sup>[590]</sup></a>. Here the
original idea of the word as denoting completeness, totality, is still
preserved.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this maze of conflicting hypotheses we might perhaps be tempted to
despair of finding our way and give up the search as hopeless. Yet I venture
to think that the true identification of the epistle in question is not,
or at least ought not to be, doubtful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. An epistle written by the Laodiceans.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The opinion that the epistle was addressed by the Laodiceans to
St Paul, and not conversely, found much support in the age of the Greek
commentators. It is mentioned by St Chrysostom as held by ‘some persons’,
though he himself does not pronounce a definite opinion on the subject<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c016'><sup>[592]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Advocates of this theory.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>It is eagerly advocated by Theodore of Mopsuestia. He supposes
that the letter of the Laodiceans contained some reflexions on the Colossian
Church, and that St Paul thought it good for the Colossians to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>what their neighbours said of them<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c016'><sup>[593]</sup></a>. Theodoret, though not mentioning
Theodore by name, follows in his footsteps<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c016'><sup>[594]</sup></a>. The same opinion is also
expressed in a note ascribed to Photius in the &OElig;cumenian Catena.
This view seems to have been very widely entertained in ancient
times. It possibly underlies the Latin Version <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ea quæ Laodicensium
est’</span><a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c016'><sup>[595]</sup></a>: it is distinctly expressed in the rendering of the Peshito, ‘that
which was written by the Laodiceans’<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c016'><sup>[596]</sup></a>. At a more recent date too it
found great favour. It was adopted on the one hand by Calvin<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c016'><sup>[597]</sup></a> and
Beza<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c016'><sup>[598]</sup></a> and Davenant and Lightfoot<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c016'><sup>[599]</sup></a>, on the other by Baronius<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c016'><sup>[600]</sup></a> and
à Lapide and Estius, besides other very considerable names<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c016'><sup>[601]</sup></a>. Latterly
its popularity has declined, but it has secured the support of one or two
commentators even in the present century.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reasons for it.</div>

<p class='c000'>The underlying motive of this interpretation was to withdraw the support
which the apocryphal epistle seemed to derive from this reference,
without being obliged at the same time to postulate a lost epistle of St
Paul. The critical argument adduced in its support was the form of expression,
τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικείας. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Objections to it.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The whole context however points to a different
explanation. The Colossian and Laodicean Epistles are obviously regarded
as in some sense companion epistles, of which the Apostle directs an interchange
between the two Churches. And again, if the letter in question had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>been written by the Laodiceans to St Paul, why should he enjoin the Colossians
to get it from Laodicea? How could he assume that a copy had been
kept by the Laodiceans; or, if kept, would be given up when required? Indeed
the difficulties in this hypothesis are so great, that nothing but the
most imperious requirements of the Greek language would justify its
acceptance. But the expression in the original makes no such demand.
It is equally competent for us to explain τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικείας either ‘the
letter written from Laodicea’, or ‘the letter to be procured from Laodicea’,
as the context may suggest. The latter accords at least as well with
Greek usage as the former<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c016'><sup>[602]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Views respecting the person addressed.</div>

<p class='c000'>The vast majority of those who interpret the expression in this way
assume that the letter was written to (α) St Paul. The modifications of
this view, which suppose it addressed to some one else, need hardly be
considered. The theory for instance, which addresses it to (β) Epaphras<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c016'><sup>[603]</sup></a>,
removes none of the objections brought against the simpler hypothesis.
Another opinion, which takes (γ) the Colossians themselves to have been
the recipients<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c016'><sup>[604]</sup></a>, does indeed dispose of one difficulty, the necessity of
assuming a copy kept by the Laodiceans, but it is even more irreconcileable
with the language of the context. Why then should St Paul so studiously
charge them to see that they read it? Why above all should he
say καὶ ὑμεῖς, ‘<em>ye also</em>’, when they were the only persons who would read it
as a matter of course?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. A letter written from Laodicea by St Paul.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. A second class of identifications rests on the supposition that it
was a letter written <em>from</em> Laodicea, though not by the Laodiceans themselves.
The considerations which recommend this hypothesis for acceptance
are the same as in the last case. It withdraws all support from the
apocryphal Epistle to the Laodiceans, and it refrains from postulating a
lost Apostolic epistle. It is not exposed to all the objections of the other
theory, but it introduces new difficulties still more serious. Here a choice
of several epistles is offered to us. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1 Timothy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(α) <cite>The First Epistle to Timothy.</cite>
This view is distinctly maintained by John Damascene<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c016'><sup>[605]</sup></a> and by Theophylact<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c016'><sup>[606]</sup></a>;
but it took its rise much earlier. It appears in the margin of the
Philoxenian Syriac<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c016'><sup>[607]</sup></a>, and it seems to have suggested the subscriptions
found in many authorities at the close of that epistle. The words ἐγράφη
ἀπὸ Λαοδικείας are found in AKL 47 etc., and many of these define the
place meant by the addition ἥτις ἐστὶ μητρόπολις Φρυγίας τῆς Πακατιανῆς.
A similar note is found in some Latin <span class='fss'>MSS</span>. It is quite possible that this
subscription was prior to the theory respecting the interpretation of Col.
iv. 16, and gave rise to it; but the converse is more probable, and in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span><span class='fss'>MSS</span> (a<sup>scr</sup>, 74) the bearing of this subscription on Col. iv. 16 is emphasized,
ἰδὸυ δὴ καὶ ἡ ἐκ Λαοδικείας. This identification has not been altogether
without support in later times<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c016'><sup>[608]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1 Thessalonians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(β) The <cite>First Epistle to the Thessalonians</cite>.
A final colophon in the Philoxenian Syriac asserts that it was
‘written from Laodicea’: and the same is stated in a later hand of d,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘scribens a Laodicea’</span>. Again an Æthiopic <span class='fss'>MS</span>, though giving Athens as
the place of writing, adds that it was ‘sent with Timotheus, <em>Tychicus</em>, and
<em>Onesimus</em><a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c016'><sup>[609]</sup></a>.’ This identification was perhaps suggested by the fact that
1 Thessalonians follows next after Colossians in the common order of St
Paul’s Epistles. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>2 Thessalonians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(γ) The <cite>Second Epistle to the Thessalonians</cite>. In the
Peshito (as given by Schaaf<a class="c016" href='#f609'><sup>[609]</sup></a>) there is a final colophon stating that this
epistle ‘was written from Laodicea of Pisidia and was sent by the hand of
Tychicus<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c016'><sup>[610]</sup></a>’. Though the addition of Pisidia wrongly defines the place as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Laodicea Combusta</em></span>, instead of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Laodicea ad Lycum</em></span>, yet the mention of
the messenger’s name shows plainly that the identification with the missing
epistle of Col. iv. 16 was contemplated. So too the Memphitic <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘per Silvanum
et <em>Tychicum</em>’</span>, and a Latin prologue <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘per Titum et <em>Onesimum</em>’</span>.
Again an Æthiopic <span class='fss'>MS</span> points to the same identification, though strangely
confused in its statements. In the superscription we are told that this
epistle was written when the Apostle was at Laodicea, but in the subscription
that it ‘was written at Athens to Laodicea and sent by Tychicus’;
while the prolegomena state that it was written and left at Laodicea, and
that afterwards, when St Paul wrote his letter to the Colossians from
Rome, he gave directions that it should be transmitted to the Thessalonians
by the Colossians<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c016'><sup>[611]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Galatians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>(δ) The <cite>Epistle to the Galatians</cite><a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c016'><sup>[612]</sup></a>. This might have
been chosen, partly because it affords no internal data for deciding where
it was written, partly because like the Colossian Epistle it is directed
against a form of Judaism, and the advocates of this hypothesis might not
be careful to distinguish the two types, though very distinct in themselves.
I find no support for it in the subscriptions, except the notice <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘per <em>Tychicum</em>’</span></span>
in some Slavonic <span class='fss'>MSS</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Objections to these solutions.</div>

<p class='c000'>The special difficulties attending this class of solutions are manifold.
(1) It does not appear that St Paul had ever been at Laodicea when he
wrote the letter to the Colossians. (2) All the epistles thus singled out
are separated from the Colossian letter by an interval of some years at
least. (3) In every case they can with a high degree of probability be
shown to have been written elsewhere than at Laodicea. Indeed, as
St Paul had been long a prisoner either at Cæsarea or at Rome, when
he wrote to Colossæ, he could not have despatched a letter recently from
Laodicea.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>3. A letter to the Laodiceans written by (<em>a</em>) St John. (<em>b</em>) A companion of St Paul. (<em>c</em>) St Paul.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>3. Thus we are thrown back on some form of the solution which
makes it a letter written <em>to the Laodiceans</em>. And here we may at once
reject the hypothesis that the writer was (<em>a</em>) St John<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c016'><sup>[613]</sup></a>. The First Epistle
of St John, which has been selected, was written (as is allowed on all hands)
much later than this date. Nor again does St Paul’s language favour
the alternative, which others have maintained, that the letter in question
was written by (<em>b</em>) one of St Paul’s companions, e.g. Epaphras or Luke<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c016'><sup>[614]</sup></a>.
The writer must therefore have been (<em>c</em>) St Paul himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this assumption three alternatives offer themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(i) A lost letter.]</div>

<p class='c000'>(i). We may suppose that the epistle in question has been lost. It has
been pointed out elsewhere that the Apostle must have written many letters
which are not preserved in our Canon<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c016'><sup>[615]</sup></a>. Thus there is no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>a priori</em></span> objection
to this solution; and, being easy and obvious in itself, it has found
common support in recent times. If therefore we had no positive reasons
for identifying the Laodicean letter with one of the extant epistles of our
Canon, we might at once close with this account of the matter. But
such reasons do exist. And moreover, as we are obliged to suppose that
at least three letters—the Epistles to the Colossians, to the Ephesians,
and to Philemon—were despatched by St Paul to Asia Minor at the
same time, it is best not to postulate a fourth, unless we are obliged to
do so.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(ii) A Canonical epistle.</div>
<p class='c000'>(ii). But, if it was not a lost letter, with which of the Canonical
Epistles of St Paul can we identify it with most probability?   Was it</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(α) Hebrews. Philastrius.</div>

<p class='c000'>(α) <em>The Epistle to the Hebrews?</em> The supporters of this hypothesis are
able to produce ancient evidence of a certain kind, though not such as
carries any real weight. Philastrius, writing about the close of the fourth
century, says that some persons ascribed the authorship of the Epistle to
the Hebrews to Luke the Evangelist, and adds that it was asserted (apparently
by these same persons, though this is not quite clear) to have been
written to the Laodiceans<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c016'><sup>[616]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Supposed testimony of <span class='fss'>MS</span> G.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Again in the Græco-Latin <span class='fss'>MS</span> G of St Paul’s

after the Epistle to Philemon, which breaks off abruptly at ver. 20, a
vacant space is left, as if for the conclusion of this epistle: and then follows
a fresh title</p>

<p class='c000'>This is evidently intended as the heading to another epistle. No other
epistle however succeeds, but the leaf containing this title is followed by
several leaves, which were originally left blank, but were filled at a later
date with extraneous matter. What then was this Epistle to the Laodiceans,
which was intended to follow, but which the scribe was prevented
from transcribing? As the Epistle to the Hebrews is not found in this
MS, and as in the common order of the Pauline Epistles it would follow the
Epistle to Philemon, the title has frequently been supposed to refer to it.
This opinion however does not appear at all probable. Anger<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c016'><sup>[617]</sup></a> indeed
argues in its favour on the ground that in the companion <span class='fss'>MS</span> F, the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Codex Augiensis</cite></span>, which (so far as regards the Greek text) must have been
derived immediately from the same archetype<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c016'><sup>[618]</sup></a>, the Epistle to the Hebrews
does really follow. But what are the facts? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Relation of G to F.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>It is plain that the Greek
texts of G and F came from the same original: but it is equally plain that
the two scribes had different Latin texts before them—that of G being the
Old Latin, and that of F Jerome’s revised Vulgate. No argument therefore
derived from the Latin text holds good for the Greek. But the
phenomena of both <span class='fss'>MSS</span> alike<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c016'><sup>[619]</sup></a> show that the Greek text of their common
archetype ended abruptly at Philem. 20 (probably owing to the loss of the
final leaves of the volume). The two scribes therefore were left severally
to the resources of their respective Latin <span class='fss'>MSS</span>. The scribe of F, whose
Greek and Latin texts are in parallel columns, concluded the Epistle to
Philemon in Latin, though he could not match it with its proper Greek;
and after this he added the Epistle to the Hebrews in Latin, no longer
however leaving a blank column, as he had done for the last few verses of
Philemon. On the other hand the Latin text in G is interlinear, the Latin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>words being written above the Greek to interpret them. When therefore
the Greek text came to an end the scribe’s work was done, for he could no
longer interlineate. But he left a blank space for the remainder of Philemon,
hoping doubtless hereafter to find a Greek <span class='fss'>MS</span> from which he could
fill it in; and he likewise gave the title of the epistle which he found next
in his Latin copy, in Greek as well as in Latin. The Greek title however
he had to supply for himself. This is clear from the form, which shows it
to have been translated from the Latin by a person who had the very
smallest knowledge of Greek. No Greek in the most barbarous age would
have written <span class="uncial">λαουδακηϲαϲ</span> for <span class="uncial">λαοδικεαϲ</span> or <span class="uncial">λαοδικηνουϲ</span>. The αου is
a Latin corruption <em>au</em> for <em>ao</em>, and the termination <span class="uncial">αϲ</span> is a Latin’s notion of
the Greek accusative. Thus the whole word is a reproduction of the Latin
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Laudicenses,’</span> the <em>en</em> being represented as usual by the Greek ε<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c016'><sup>[620]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The spurious Laodicean Epistle intended.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>If so,
we have only to ask what writing would probably appear as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Epistola ad
Laudicenses</em></span> in a Latin copy; and to this question there can be only one
answer. The apocryphal Epistle to the Laodiceans occurs frequently in
the Latin Bibles, being found at least two or three centuries before the
<span class='fss'>MS</span> G was written. Though it does not usually follow the Epistle to
Philemon, yet its place varies very considerably in different Latin copies,
and an instance will be given below<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c016'><sup>[621]</sup></a> where it actually occurs in this
position.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>This identification unsatisfactory.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus beyond the notice in Philastrius there is no ancient support for
the identification of the missing letter of Col. iv. 16 with the Epistle
to the Hebrews; and doubtless the persons to whom Philastrius alludes
had no more authority for their opinion than their modern successors.
Critical conjecture, not historical tradition, led them to this result.
The theory therefore must stand or fall by its own merits. It has
been maintained by one or two modern writers<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c016'><sup>[622]</sup></a>, chiefly on the ground of
some partial coincidences between the Epistles to the Hebrews and the
Colossians; but the general character and purport of the two is wholly
dissimilar, and they obviously deal with antagonists of a very different
type. The insuperable difficulty of supposing that two epistles so unlike
in style were written by the same person to the same neighbourhood at
or about the same time would still remain, even though the Pauline
authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews should be for a moment granted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(β) Philemon.</div>

<p class='c000'>(β) The <cite>Epistle to Philemon</cite> has been strongly advocated by Wieseler<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c016'><sup>[623]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>as the letter to which St Paul refers in this passage. For this identification
it is necessary to establish two points; (1) that Philemon lived not at
Colossæ, but at Laodicea; and (2) that the letter is addressed not to a
private individual, but to a whole church. For the first point there is
something to be said. Though for reasons explained elsewhere the abode
of Philemon himself appears to have been at Colossæ, wherever Archippus
may have resided<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c016'><sup>[624]</sup></a>, still two opinions may very fairly be held on this point.
But Wieseler’s arguments entirely fail to establish his other position. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>This epistle does not answer the conditions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The
theme, the treatment, the whole tenour of the letter, mark it as private: and
the mere fact that the Apostle’s courtesy leads him to include in the opening
salutation the Christians who met at Philemon’s house is powerless to
change its character. Why should a letter, containing such intimate
confidences, be read publicly in the Church, not only at Laodicea but at
Colossæ, by the express order of the Apostle? The tact and delicacy
of the Apostle’s pleading for Onesimus would be nullified at one stroke
by the demand for publication.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(γ) Ephesians.</div>

<p class='c000'>(γ) But may we not identify the letter in question with the <cite>Epistle to the
Ephesians</cite>, which also is known to have been despatched at the same time
with the Epistle to the Colossians? Unlike the Epistle to Philemon, it
was addressed not to a private person but to a church or churches. If
therefore it can be shown that the Laodiceans were the recipients, either
alone or with others, we have found the object of our search. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>This is the true solution.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The arguments
in favour of this solution are reserved for the introduction to that
epistle. Meanwhile it is sufficient to say that educated opinion is tending,
though slowly, in this direction, and to express the belief that ultimately
this view will be generally received<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c016'><sup>[625]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(iii) The extant un-canonical Epistle to the Laodiceans.</div>

<p class='c000'>(iii) Another wholly different identification remains to be mentioned.
It was neither a lost epistle nor a Canonical epistle, thought some, but
the writing which is extant under the title of the ‘Epistle to the Laodiceans,’
though not generally received by the Church. Of the various
opinions held respecting this apocryphal letter I shall have to speak
presently. It is sufficient here to say that the advocates of its genuineness
fall into two classes. Either they assign to it a place in the Canon with
the other Epistles of St Paul, or they acquiesce in its exclusion, holding
that the Church has authority to pronounce for or against the Canonicity
even of Apostolic writings.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>General character of the spurious epistle.</div>

<p class='c000'>The apocryphal Epistle to the Laodiceans is a cento of Pauline
phrases strung together without any definite connexion or any clear object.
They are taken chiefly from the Epistle to the Philippians, but here and
there one is borrowed elsewhere, e.g. from the Epistle to the Galatians.
Of course it closes with an injunction to the Laodiceans to exchange
epistles with the Colossians. The Apostle’s injunction in Col. iv. 16
suggested the forgery, and such currency as it ever attained was due to
the support which that passage was supposed to give to it. Unlike most
forgeries, it had no ulterior aim. It was not framed to advance any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>particular opinions, whether heterodox or orthodox. It has no doctrinal
peculiarities. Thus it is quite harmless, so far as falsity and stupidity
combined can ever be regarded as harmless.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <cite>Fuldensis</cite> [F]. The famous <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Vulgate N. T. written for
Victor Bishop of Capua, by whom it was read and corrected in the years
546, 547; edited by Ern. Ranke, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Marburgi et Lipsiæ</cite></span> 1868. The Laodicean
Epistle occurs between Col. and 1 Tim. without any indication of doubtful
authenticity, except that it has no argument or table of contents, like the
other epistles. The scribe however has erroneously interpolated part of
the argument belonging to 1 Tim. between the title and the epistle; see
p. 291 sq. of Ranke’s edition.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <cite>Cavensis.</cite> A <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the whole Latin Bible, at the Monastery of La
Cava near Salerno, ascribed to the 6th or 7th or 8th century. See Vercellone
<cite>Var. Lect. Vulg. Lat. Bibl.</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. lxxxviii. Unfortunately we have no
account of the readings in the Laodicean Epistle (for which it would be the
most important authority after the Codex Fuldensis), except the last sentence
quoted by Mai <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Nov. Patr. Bibl.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> 2. p. 63, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Et facite legi Colossensium
vobis.’</span> Laod. here occurs between Col. and 1 Thess. (Mai p. 62).
Dr Westcott (Smith’s <cite>Dict. of the Bible s.v. Vulgate</cite>, p. 1713) has remarked
that the two oldest authorities for the interpolation of the three heavenly
witnesses in 1 Joh. v. 7, this La Cava <span class='fss'>MS</span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum</cite></span> published by
Mai, also support the Laodicean Epistle (see Mai l.c. pp. 7, 62 sq.). The
two phenomena are combined in another very ancient MS, Brit. Mus. <em>Add.</em>
11,852, described below.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <cite>Armachanus</cite> [A]. A <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the N. T., now belonging to Trinity
College, Dublin, and known as the ‘Book of Armagh.’ It was written in the
year 807, as ascertained by Bp. Graves; see the <cite>Proceedings of the Royal
Irish Academy</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span> pp. 316, 356. The Laodicean Epistle follows Colossians
on fol. 138, but with the warning that Jerome denies its genuineness. The
text of the Laodicean Epistle in this MS is not so pure as might have been
anticipated from its antiquity. I owe the collation of readings which is
given below to the kindness of Dr Reeves, who is engaged in editing the <span class='fss'>MS</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <cite>Darmstadiensis</cite> [D]. A fol. <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the whole Bible, defective from
Apoc. xxii. 12 to the end, now in the Grand-ducal library at Darmstadt,
but formerly belonging to the Cathedral Library at Cologne; presented
by Hermann Pius, Archbishop of Cologne from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 890–925. Laod. follows
Col. A collation was made for Anger, from whom (p. 144) this account
is taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <cite>Bernensis</cite> no. 334 [B]. A 4to <span class='fss'>MS</span> of miscellaneous contents, ending
with the Pauline Epistles, the last being the Epistle to the Laodiceans,
written in the 9th cent. The Laodicean Epistle is a fragment, ending with
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Gaudete in Christo et præcavete sordibus in lucro’</span> (ver. 13). This account
is taken by Anger from Sinner <cite>Catal. Cod. <span class='fss'>MSS.</span> Bibl. Bern.</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 28. In
his Addenda (p. 179) Anger gives a collation of this <span class='fss'>MS</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. <cite>Toletanus</cite> [T] A <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Latin Bible belonging to the Cathedral
Library at Toledo, and written about the 8th century: see Westcott in Smith’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span><cite>Dict. of the Bible</cite>, s.v. <em>Vulgate</em> p. 1710, Vercellone <cite>Var. Lect.</cite> <span class='fss'>I</span>. p. lxxxiv.
sq.  The readings in the Laodicean Epistle are taken from Joh. Mariana
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Schol. in Vet. et Nov. Test.</cite></span>, where it is printed in full. The edition which
I have used is dated Paris 1620 (p. 831). The text however cannot be
assumed to be strictly accurate, as Mariana had a printed copy of the
epistle before him, from which at all events he supplied in brackets words
wanting in the <span class='fss'>MS</span> (see Anger p. 144), and which may have influenced his
readings in other ways. In this <span class='fss'>MS</span> Laod. follows Col.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. <cite>Parisiensis</cite> Reg. Lat. 3 (formerly 3562)<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c016'><sup>[626]</sup></a> [P<sub>1</sub>]. A Latin Bible, in
one volume fol., called after Anowaretha by whom it was given to the
monastery of Glanfeuille (St Maur), and ascribed in the printed Catalogue
to the 9th cent. Laod. follows Col. on fol. 379.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <cite>Parisiensis</cite> Reg. Lat. 6 [P<sub>2</sub>]. A <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Latin Bible in 4 vols.
fol., according to the Catalogue probably written in the 10th cent. [?]. It
belonged formerly to the Duc de Noailles. Laod. follows Col. It contains
numerous corrections in a later hand either between the lines or in the
margin. The two hands are distinguished as P<sub>2</sub>*, P<sub>2</sub>**.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. <cite>Parisiensis</cite> Reg. Lat. 250 (formerly 3572) [P<sub>3</sub>]. A fol. <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the
N. T., described in the Catalogue as probably belonging to end of the 9th
cent. Laod. follows Col. It has a few corrections in a later hand. The
two hands are distinguished as P<sub>3</sub>*, P<sub>3</sub>**.</p>

<p class='c000'>These three Parisian <span class='fss'>MSS</span> I collated myself, but I had not time to examine
them as carefully as I could have wished.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite> Add. 11,852. [G]. An important <span class='fss'>MS</span> of St Paul’s
Epistles written in the 9th cent. It formerly belonged to the monastery of
St Gall, being one of the books with which the library there was enriched by
Hartmot who was Abbot from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 872 to 884 or 885. Laod. follows Heb.
and has no capitula like the other epistles.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite> Add. 10,546 [C]. A fol. <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Vulgate, commonly
known as ‘Charlemagne’s Bible,’ but probably belonging to the age of
Charles the Bald († 877). Laod. stands between Heb. and Apoc. It has
no argument or capitula.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite> Reg. 1. E. vii, viii [R]. An English <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Latin
Bible from Christ Church, Canterbury, written about the middle of the
10th cent. Laod. follows Heb. This is the most ancient <span class='fss'>MS</span>, so far as I am
aware, in which the epistle has capitulations. It is here given in its fullest
form, and thus presents the earliest example of what may be called the
modern recension.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite> Harl. 2833, 2834 [H<sub>1</sub>]. A <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the 13th cent. written
for the Cathedral of Angers. Laod. follows Apoc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The readings of the four preceding <span class='fss'>MSS</span> are taken from the collations
in Westcott <cite>Canon</cite> Appx. E p. 572 sq. (ed. 4).</p>

<p class='c000'>14. <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite> Harl. 3131 [H<sub>2</sub>]. A smallish 4to. of the 12th cent.,
said to be of German origin, with marginal and interlinear glosses in some
parts. Laod. stands between Philem. and Heb. It has no heading but
only a red initial letter P. At the end is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">'Expl. Ep̅la̅ ad Laodicenses.
Prologus ad Ebreos.'</span></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>15. <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite> Sloane 539 [S]. A small fol. of the 12th cent., said to be
German. It contains St Paul’s Epistles with glosses. The gloss on
Col. iv. 16 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘et ea quæ est Laodicensium etc.’ runs ‘quam ego eis misi ut ipsi
michi ut videatis hic esse responsum.’</span> Laod. follows Heb., and has no
glosses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two last <span class='fss'>MSS</span> I collated myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. <cite>Bodl.</cite> Laud. Lat. 13 (formerly 810) [L<sub>1</sub>]. A 4to <span class='fss'>MS</span> in double

Cod. Lat.</cite> p. 10. Laod. follows Col. Notwithstanding the date of the <span class='fss'>MS</span>,
it gives a very ancient text of this epistle.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. <cite>Bodl.</cite> Laud. Lat. 8 (formerly 757) [L<sub>2</sub>]. A fol. <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Latin

Lat.</cite> p. 9. This is the same <span class='fss'>MS</span>, which Anger describes (p. 145) as 115C
(its original mark), and of which he gives a collation. Laod. stands between
2 Thess. and 1 Tim.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am indebted for collations of these two Laudian <span class='fss'>MSS</span> to the kindness
of the Rev. J. Wordsworth, Fellow of Brasenose College.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. <cite>Vindob.</cite> 287 [V]. The Pauline Epp., written by Marianus Scotus

<p class='c000'>19. <cite>Trin. Coll. Cantabr.</cite> B. 5. 1 [X]. A fol. <span class='fss'>MS</span> of the Latin Bible,
written probably in the 12th century. Laod. follows Col. I have given a
collation of this <span class='fss'>MS</span>, because (like Brit. Mus. Reg. 1. E. viii) it is an early
example of the completed form. The epistle is preceded by capitula, as
follows.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Incipiunt Capitula Epistole ad Laodicenses.</span></span></div>

<p class='c000'>These capitulations may be compared with those given by Dr Westcott
from Reg. 1. E. viii, with which they are nearly identical.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these nineteen <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, of which (with the exception of <em>Cavensis</em>)
collations are given below, it may be worth while recording the following,
as containing this epistle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Lambeth <span class='fss'>MSS</span> are (i) no. 4, large folio, 12th or 13th cent.
Laod. stands between Col. and 1 Thess. (ii) no. 90, small folio, 13th or
14th cent. Laod. stands between Col. and 1 Thess. without title or heading
of any kind. Apparently a good text. (iii) no. 348, 4to, 15th cent. Laod.
stands between Col. and 1 Thess., without heading etc. (iv) no. 544, 8vo,
15th cent. Laod. stands between Col. and 1 Thess., without heading etc.
(v) no. 1152, 4to, 13th or 14th cent. Laod. occupies the same position as
in the four preceding <span class='fss'>MSS</span> and has no heading or title. The first and last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>of these five <span class='fss'>MSS</span> are collated by Dr Westcott (<cite>Canon</cite> p. 572 sq.). I inspected
them all.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Bodleian Library at Oxford belonging to the Canonici collection
are (i) Canon. Bibl. 82 (see <cite>Catal.</cite> p. 277), very small 4to, 13th cent., containing
parts of the N. T. St Paul’s Epp. are at the end of the volume,
following Apoc. Laod. intervenes between Tit. and Philem., beginning
‘Explicit epistola ad titum. Incipit ad laud.’, and ending ‘Explicit epistola
ad laudicenses. Incipit ad phylemonem’. (ii) Canon. Bibl. 7 (see <cite>Catal.</cite>
p. 251), small 4to, beginning of 14th cent., containing Evv., Acts, Cath.
Epp., Apoc., Paul. Epp. Laod. is at the end. (iii) Canon. Bibl. 16 (<cite>Catal.</cite>
p. 256), small 4to, containing the N. T., 15th cent., written by the hand
‘Stephani de Tautaldis’. Laod. follows Col. (iv) Canon. Bibl. 25 (<cite>Catal.</cite>
p. 258), very small 4to, mutilated, early part of 15th cent. It contains
a part of St Paul’s Epp. (beginning in the middle of Gal.) and the Apocalypse.
Laod. follows Col. For information respecting these <span class='fss'>MSS</span> I am
indebted to the Rev. J. Wordsworth.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the University Library, Cambridge, I have observed the Epistle to the
Laodiceans in the following <span class='fss'>MSS</span>. (i) Dd. 5. 52 (see <cite>Catal.</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 273), 4to,
double columns, 14th cent. Laod. is between Col. and 1 Thess. (ii) Ee.
I. 9 (see <cite>Catal.</cite> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 10), 4to, double columns, very small neat hand, 15th
cent. It belonged to St Alban’s. Laod. is between Col. and 1 Thess.
(iii) Mm. 3. 2 (see <cite>Catal.</cite> <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 174), fol., Latin Bible, double columns, 13th
cent. Laod. is between Col. and 1 Thess., but the heading is ‘Explicit
epistola ad Colocenses, et hic incipit ad thesalocenses’, after which Laod.
follows immediately. At the top of the page is ‘Ad Laudonenses’.
(iv) Ee. <span class='fss'>I.</span> 16 (see <cite>Catal.</cite> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 16), 4to, double columns, Latin Bible, 13th
or 14th cent. The order of the N. T. is Evv., Acts, Cath. Epp., Paul Epp.,
Apoc. Here Laod. is between Heb. and Rev.; it is treated like the other
books, except that it has no prologue.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the College Libraries at Cambridge I have accidentally noticed the
following <span class='fss'>MSS</span> as containing the epistle; for I have not undertaken any
systematic search. (i) St Peter’s, O. 4. 6, fol., 2 columns, 13th cent., Latin
Bible. The order of the N. T. is Evv., Acts, Cath. Epp., Paul Epp., Apoc.
The Epistle to the Laodiceans is between Heb. and Apoc. (ii) Sidney Δ.
5. 11, fol., 2 columns, Latin Bible, 13th cent. The order of the N. T. is
Evv., Paul. Epp., Acts, Cath. Epp., Apoc.; and Laod. is between 2 Thess.
and 1 Tim. (iii) Emman. 2. 1. 6, large fol., Latin Bible, early 14th cent. The
order of the N. T. is different from the last, being Evv., Acts, Cath. Epp.,
Paul. Epp.; Apoc.; but Laod. is in the same position, between 2 Thess. and
1 Tim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notice of a few other <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, in which this epistle occurs, will be found
in Hody <cite>de Bibl. Text. Orig.</cite> p. 664, and in Anger p. 145 sq.</p>

<p class='c000'>This list, slight and partial as it is, will serve to show the wide circulation
of the Laodicean Epistle. At the same time it will have been observed
that its position varies very considerably in different copies.</p>

<p class='c000'>(i) The most common position is immediately after Colossians, as the
notice in Col. iv. 16 would suggest. This is its place in the most ancient
authorities, e.g. the Fulda, La Cava, and Toledo <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, and the Book of
Armagh.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>(ii) Another position is after 2 Thess. So Laud. Lat. 8, Sidn. [Delta]. 5. 11,
Emman. 2. 1. 6: see also <span class='fss'>MSS</span> in Hody <cite>Bibl. Text. Orig.</cite> p. 664. It must
be remembered that in the Latin Bibles the Epistles to the Thessalonians
sometimes precede and sometimes follow the Epistle to the Colossians.
Hence we get three arrangements in different <span class='fss'>MSS</span>; (1) 1, 2 Thess., Col.,
Laod.; (2) Col., Laod., 1, 2 Thess.; (3) Col., 1, 2 Thess., Laod.</p>

<p class='c000'>(iii) It occurs at least in one instance between Titus and Philemon;
Oxon. Bodl. Canon. 82. Mai also (<cite>Nov. Patr. Bibl.</cite> <span class='fss'>I</span>. 2. p. 63) mentions
a ‘very ancient <span class='fss'>MS</span>’, in which it stands between Titus and 1 John;
but he does not say how Titus and 1 John appear in such close neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>(iv) Again it follows Philemon in Brit. Mus. Harl. 3131. This also
must have been its position in the Latin <span class='fss'>MS</span> which the scribe of the Codex
Boernerianus had before him: see above p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>(v) Another and somewhat common position is after Hebrews; e.g.
Brit. Mus. Add. 11,852, Add. 10,546, Reg. <span class='fss'>I.</span> E. viii, Sloane 539, Camb.
Univ. Ee. <span class='fss'>I.</span> 16, Pet. O. 4. 6. See also Hody l.c.</p>

<p class='c000'>(vi) It is frequently placed at the end of the New Testament, and so
after the Apocalypse when the Apocalypse comes last, e.g. Harl. 2833.
Sometimes the Pauline Epistles follow the Apocalypse, so that Laod. occurs
at the end at once of the Pauline Epistles and of the N. T.; e.g. Bodl.
Canon. Lat. 7.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other exceptional positions, e.g. after Galatians or after 3 John, are
found in versions and printed texts (see Anger p. 143); but no authority
of Latin <span class='fss'>MSS</span> is quoted for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Codex Fuldensis</cite></span>, besides being the oldest <span class='fss'>MS</span>, is also by far the
most trustworthy. In some instances indeed a true reading may be preserved
in later <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, where it has a false one; but such cases are rare.
The text however was already corrupt in several places at this time;
and the variations in the later <span class='fss'>MSS</span> are most frequently attempts of the
scribes to render it intelligible by alteration or amplification. Such
for instance is the case with the mutilated reading <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quod est’</span> (ver. 13),
which is amplified, even as early as the Book of Armagh, into <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quodcunque
optimum est’</span>, though there can be little doubt that the expression
represents τὸ λοιπόν of Phil. iii. 2, and the missing word therefore is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘reliquum’</span>.
The greatest contrast to F is presented by such <span class='fss'>MSS</span> as RX, where
the epistle has not only been filled out to the amplest proportions, but also
supplied with a complete set of capitulations like the Canonical books.
Though for this reason these two <span class='fss'>MSS</span> have no great value, yet they are
interesting as being among the oldest which give the amplified text, and I
have therefore added a collation of them. On the other hand some much
later <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, especially L<sub>1</sub>, preserve a very ancient text, which closely resembles
that of F.<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c016'><sup>[627]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Notes on the epistle.</div>

<p class='c000'>The following notes are added for the sake of elucidating one or two
points of difficulty in the text or interpretation of the epistle.</p>

<p class='c000'>4 Neque] This is the passage quoted in the <cite>Speculum</cite> § 50 published by
Mai <em>Nov. Patr. Bibl.</em> <span class='fss'>I.</span> 2. p. 62 sq., <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Item ad Laodicenses: Neque destituat
vos quorundam vaneloquentia (<em>sic</em>) insinuantium, ut vos avertant a veritate
evangelii quod a me praedicatur’.</span> We ought possibly to adopt the reading
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘destituat ... vaniloquentia’</span> of this and other old mss in preference to the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘destituant ... vaniloquia’</span> of F. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Vaniloquium’</span> however is the rendering of
ματαιολογία 1 Tim. i. 6, and is supported by such analogies as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inaniloquium,
maliloquium, multiloquium, stultiloquium,</span> etc.; see Hagen <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Sprachl. Erörter.
zur Vulgata</cite></span> p. 74, Roensch <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Das Neue Testament Tertullians</cite></span> p. 710.</p>

<p class='c000'>destituant] Properly ‘<em>leave in the lurch</em>’ and so ‘<em>cheat</em>’, ‘<em>beguile</em>’, e.g.
Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>pro Rosc. Am.</cite></span> 40 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘induxit, decepit, destituit, adversariis tradidit, omni
fraude et perfidia fefellit.’</span> In Heb. ix. 26 εἰς ἀθέτησιν τῆς ἁμαρτίας is translated
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ad destitutionem peccati’</span>. The original here may have been ἐξαπατήσωσιν
or ἀθετήσωσιν.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insinuantium] In late Latin this word means
little more than ‘to communicate’, ‘to inculcate’, ‘to teach’: see the references
in Roensch <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Itala u. Vulgata</cite></span> p. 387, Heumann <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Handlexicon des
römischen Rechts</cite></span> s.v., Ducange <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Glossarium</cite></span> s.v. So too ‘insinuator’ Tertull.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad Nat.</cite></span> ii. 1, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘insinuatrix’</span> August. <cite>Ep.</cite> 110 (II. p. 317). In Acts
xvii. 3 it is the rendering of παρατιθέμενος.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>5 ut qui sunt etc.] The passage, as it stands, is obviously corrupt; and
a comparison with Phil. i. 12  τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ μᾶλλον εἰς προκοπὴν τοῦ  εὐαγγελίου
ἐλήλυθεν seems to reveal the nature of the corruption. (1) For
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘qui’</span> we should probably read <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quæ’</span>, which indeed is found in some
late MSS of no authority. (2) There is a lacuna somewhere in the sentence,
probably after <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘evangelii’</span>. The original therefore would run in this
form <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ut quæ sunt ex me ad profectum veritatis [eveniant] ... deservientes
etc.,’</span> the participles belonging to a separate sentence of which the beginning
is lost. The supplements ‘perveniant’, ‘proficiant’, found in some MSS give
the right sense, though perhaps they are conjectural. The Vulgate of Phil.
i. 12 is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quæ circa me sunt magis ad profectum venerunt evangelii’</span>. In the
latter part of the verse it is impossible in many cases to say whether a
MS intends <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘operum quæ’</span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘operumque’</span>; but the former is probably
correct, as representing ἐργων τῶν τῆς σωτηρίας: unless indeed this sentence
also is corrupt or mutilated.</p>

<p class='c000'>7 administrante etc.] Considering the diversity of readings here, we
may perhaps venture on the emendation <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘administratione spiritus sancti’</span>,
as this more closely resembles the passage on which our text is founded,
Phil. i. 19 διὰ τῆς ὑμῶν δεήσεως καὶ ἐπιχορηγίας τοῦ πνεύματος κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c000'>12 retractu] ‘<em>wavering</em>’, ‘<em>hesitation</em>’. For this sense of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘retractare’</span>,
‘to rehandle, discuss’, and so ‘to question, hesitate’, and even ‘to shirk,
decline’, see Oehler <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Tertullian</cite></span>, index p. cxciii, Roensch <cite>N. T. Tertullian’s</cite>
p. 669, Ducange <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Glossarium</cite></span> s.v.: comp. e.g. Iren. v. 11. 1 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ne relinqueretur
quæstio his qui infideliter retractant de eo’</span>. So <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘retractator’</span> is equivalent
to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘detractator’</span> in Tert. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Jejun.</cite></span> 15 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘retractatores hujus officii’</span> (see
Oehler’s note); and in 1 Sam. xiv. 39 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘absque retractatione morietur’</span> is the
rendering of ‘dying he shall die’, θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται. Here the expression
probably represents χωρὶς ... διαλογισμῶν of Phil. ii. 14, which in the Old Latin
is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘sine ... detractionibus’</span>. All three forms occur, retractus (Tert. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Scorp.</cite></span> 1),
retractatus (Tert. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apol.</cite></span> 4, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Marc.</cite></span> i. 1, v. 3, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>adv. Prax.</cite></span> 2, and frequently),
retractatio (Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Tusc.</cite></span> v. 29, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘sine retractatione’</span> and so frequently; 1 Sam.
l. c). Here <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘retractus’</span> must be preferred, both as being the least common
form and as having the highest MS authority. In Tert. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Scorp.</cite></span> 1 however
it is not used in this same sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>13 quod est reliquum] I have already spoken of this passage, p. 352, and
shall have to speak of it again, p. 357. The oldest and most trustworthy
MSS have simply <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quod est’</span>. The word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘reliquum’</span> must be supplied, as
Anger truly discerned (p. 163); for the passage is taken from Phil. iii. 1 τὸ
λοιπόν, ἀδελφοί μου, χαίρετε ἐν Κυρίῳ. See the Vulgate translation of τὸ
λοιπόν in 1 Cor. vii. 29. Later and less trustworthy authorities supply
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘optimum’</span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘bonum’</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>14  in sensu Christi] ‘<em>in the mind of Christ</em>’: for in 1 Cor. ii. 16 νοῦν
Χριστοῦ is rendered <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘sensum Christi’</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>20 facite legi etc.] Though the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Colosensibus et’</span> are wanting in
very many of the authorities which are elsewhere most trustworthy, yet I
have felt justified in retaining them with other respectable copies, because
(1) The hom&oelig;oteleuton would account for their omission even in very ancient
MSS; (2) The parallelism with Col. iv. 16 requires their insertion;
(3) The insertion is not like the device of a Latin scribe, who would hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>have manipulated the sentence into a form which savours so strongly of a
Greek original.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<div class='sidenote'>Theory of a Greek original discussed.</div>

<p class='c000'>It is the general, though not universal, opinion that this epistle was altogether
a forgery of the Western Church<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c016'><sup>[628]</sup></a>; and consequently that the
Latin is not a translation from a lost Greek original, but preserves the
earliest form of the epistle. Though the forgery doubtless attained its
widest circulation in the West, there are, I venture to think, strong reasons
for dissenting from this opinion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Frequent Grecisms in the epistle.</div>

<p class='c000'>If we read the epistle in its most authentic form, divested of the additions
contributed by the later <span class='fss'>MSS</span>, we are struck with its cramped style.
Altogether it has not the run of a Latin original. And, when we come to
examine it in detail, we find that this constraint is due very largely to the
fetters imposed by close adherence to Greek idiom. Thus for instance we
have ver. 5 ‘<em>qui</em> [or <em>quæ</em>] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sunt ex me</em></span>’, οἱ [or τὰ] ἐξ ἐμοῦ; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>operum quæ
salutis</em></span>, ἐργων τῶν τῆς σωτηρίας; ver. 6 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>palam vincula mea quæ patior</em></span>,
φανεροὶ οἱ δεσμοί μου ὃυς ὑπομένω; ver. 13 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sordidos in lucro</em></span>, αἰσχροκερδεῖς;
ver. 20 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>et facite legi Colosensibus et Colosensium vobis</em></span>, καὶ ποιήσατε ἵνα τοῖς
Κολασσαεῦσιν ἀναγνωσθῇ καὶ ἡ Κολασσαέων ἵνα [καὶ] ὑμῖν. It is quite
possible indeed that parallels for some of these anomalies may be found in
Latin writers. Thus Tert. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>c. Marc.</cite></span> i. 23 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘redundantia justitiæ super <em>scribarum
et Pharisæorum</em>’</span> is quoted to illustrate the genitive <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Colossensium’</span>
ver. 20.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c016'><sup>[629]</sup></a> The Greek cast however is not confined to one or two
expressions but extends to the whole letter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>It differs widely from the Old Latin and Vulgate Versions.</div>

<p class='c000'>But a yet stronger argument in favour of a Greek original remains.
This epistle, as we saw, is a cento of passages from St Paul. If it had been
written originally in Latin, we should expect to find that the passages were
taken directly from the Latin versions. This however is not the case. Thus

Version are easily explained on the ground that reminiscences of this
version would naturally occur to the translator of the epistle. The
habitual divergences from it are only accounted for on the hypothesis that
the original compiler was better acquainted with the New Testament in
Greek than in Latin, and therefore presumably that he wrote in Greek.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>External testimony to the same effect.</div>

<p class='c000'>And, if we are led to this conclusion by an examination of the epistle
itself, we shall find it confirmed by an appeal to external testimony.
There is ample evidence that a spurious Epistle to the Laodiceans was
known to Greek writers, as well as Latin, at a sufficiently early date. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>[Muratorian Fragment].<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>A
mention of such an epistle occurs as early as the Muratorian Fragment on
the Canon (about A.D. 170), where the writer speaks of two letters, one to
the Laodiceans and another to the Alexandrians, as circulated under the
name of Paul<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c016'><sup>[630]</sup></a>. The bearing of the words however is uncertain. He may
be referring to the Marcionite recension of the canonical Epistle to the
Ephesians, which was entitled by that heretic an Epistle to the Laodiceans<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c016'><sup>[631]</sup></a>.
Or, if this explanation of his words be not correct (as perhaps it is not),
still we should not feel justified in assuming that he is referring to the extant
apocryphal epistle. Indeed we should hardly expect that an epistle
of this character would be written and circulated at so early a date. The
reference in Col. iv. 16 offered a strong temptation to the forger, and probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>more than one unscrupulous person was induced by it to try his hand at
falsification<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c016'><sup>[632]</sup></a>. But, however this may be, it seems clear that before the close
of the fourth century our epistle was largely circulated in the East and West
alike. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Jerome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>‘Certain persons’, writes Jerome in his account of St Paul, ‘read
also an Epistle to the Laodiceans, but it is rejected by all<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c016'><sup>[633]</sup></a>’. No doubt is
entertained, that this father refers to our epistle. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Theodore.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>If then we find that
about the same time Theodore of Mopsuestia also mentions an Epistle to
the Laodiceans, which he condemns as spurious<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c016'><sup>[634]</sup></a>, it is a reasonable inference
that the same writing is meant. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Theodoret.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In this he is followed by Theodoret<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c016'><sup>[635]</sup></a>; and
indeed the interpretations of Col. iv. 16 given by the Greek Fathers of this
age were largely influenced as we have seen, by the presence of a spurious
epistle which they were anxious to discredit<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c016'><sup>[636]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>2nd Council of Nicæa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Even two or three centuries
later the epistle seems to have been read in the East. At the Second
Council of Nicæa (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 787) it was found necessary to warn people against
‘a forged Epistle to the Laodiceans’ which was ‘circulated, having a place
in some copies of the Apostle<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c016'><sup>[637]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Scanty circulation in the East,</div>

<p class='c000'>But, though written originally in Greek, it was not among Greek Christians
that this epistle attained its widest circulation. In the latter part of
the 8th century indeed, when the Second Council of Nicæa met, it had found
its way into some copies of St Paul’s Epistles<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c016'><sup>[639]</sup></a>. But the denunciation of
this Council seems to have been effective in securing its ultimate exclusion.
We discover no traces of it in any extant Greek <span class='fss'>MS</span>, with the very doubtful
exception which has already been considered<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c016'><sup>[640]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>but wide diffusion in the West.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But in the Latin Church
the case was different. St Jerome, as we saw, had pronounced very decidedly
against it. Yet even his authority was not sufficient to stamp it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>out. At least as early as the sixth century it found a place in some copies
of the Latin Bibles: and before the close of that century its genuineness was
affirmed by perhaps the most influential theologian whom the Latin Church
produced during the eleven centuries which elapsed between the age of
Jerome and Augustine and the era of the Reformation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Gregory the Great.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Gregory the Great
did not indeed affirm its canonicity. He pronounced that the Church had
restricted the canonical Epistles of St Paul to fourteen, and he found a
mystical explanation of this limitation in the number itself, which was attained
by adding the number of the Commandments to the number of the
Gospels and thus fitly represented the teaching of the Apostle which combines
the two<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c016'><sup>[641]</sup></a>. But at the same time he states that the Apostle wrote
fifteen; and, though he does not mention the Epistle to the Laodiceans by
name, there can be little doubt that he intended to include this as his
fifteenth epistle, and that his words were rightly understood by subsequent
writers as affirming its Pauline authorship. The influence of this great
name is perceptible in the statements of later writers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Haymo of Halberstadt.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Haymo of Halberstadt,
who died <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 853, commenting on Col. iv. 16, says, The Apostle ‘enjoins
the Laodicean Epistle to be read to the Colossians, because though it
is very short and is not reckoned in the Canon, yet still it has some use<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c016'><sup>[642]</sup></a>’.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hervey of Dole.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And between two or three centuries later Hervey of Dole (c. <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1130), if it
be not Anselm of Laon<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c016'><sup>[643]</sup></a>, commenting on this same passage, says: ‘Although
the Apostle wrote this epistle also as his fifteenth or sixteenth<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c016'><sup>[644]</sup></a>, and it is
established by Apostolic authority like the rest, yet holy Church does not
reckon more than fourteen,’ and he proceeds to justify this limitation of
the Canon with the arguments and in the language of Gregory<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c016'><sup>[645]</sup></a>. Others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>however did not confine themselves to the qualified recognition given to the
epistle by the great Bishop of Rome. Gregory had carefully distinguished
between genuineness and canonicity; but this important distinction was not
seldom disregarded by later writers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>English Church. Aelfric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In the English Church more especially
it was forgotten. Thus Aelfric abbot of Cerne, who wrote during the
closing years of the tenth century, speaks as follows of St Paul: ‘Fifteen
epistles wrote this one Apostle to the nations by him converted unto the
faith: which are large books in the Bible and make much for our amendment,
if we follow his doctrine that was teacher of the Gentiles’. He then
gives a list of the Apostle’s writings, which closes with ‘one to Philemon
and one to the Laodiceans; fifteen in all as loud as thunder to faithful
people<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c016'><sup>[646]</sup></a>’. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>John of Salisbury.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Again, nearly two centuries later John of Salisbury, likewise
writing on the Canon, reckons ‘Fifteen epistles of Paul included in one
volume, though it be the wide-spread and common opinion of nearly all that
there are only fourteen; ten to churches and four to individuals: supposing
that the one addressed to the Hebrews is to be reckoned among the Epistles
of Paul, as Jerome the doctor of doctors seems to lay down in his preface,
where he refuteth the cavils of those who contended that it was not Paul’s.
But the fifteenth is that which is addressed to the Church of the Laodiceans;
and though, as Jerome saith, it be rejected by all, nevertheless was
it written by the Apostle. Nor is this opinion assumed on the conjecture
of others, but it is confirmed by the testimony of the Apostle himself: for
he maketh mention of it in the Epistle to the Colossians in these words,
<em>When this epistle shall have been read among you</em>, etc. (Col. iv. 16)<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c016'><sup>[647]</sup></a>’.
Aelfric and John are the typical theologians of the Church in this country
in their respective ages. The Conquest effected a revolution in ecclesiastical
and theological matters. The Old English Church was separated from
the Anglo-Norman Church in not a few points both of doctrine and of discipline.
Yet here we find the representative men of learning in both agreed
on this one point—the authorship and canonicity of the Epistle to the
Laodiceans. From the language of John of Salisbury however it appears
that such was not the common verdict at least in his age, and that on this
point the instinct of the many was more sound than the learning of the few.
Nor indeed was it the undisputed opinion even of the learned in this country
during this interval. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The epistle repudiated by Lanfranc.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The first Norman Archbishop, Lanfranc, an Italian
by birth and education, explains the passage in the Colossian Epistle as
referring to a letter written by the Laodiceans to the Apostle, and adds that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>otherwise ‘there would be more than thirteen Epistles of Paul<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c016'><sup>[648]</sup></a>’. Thus
he tacitly ignores the Epistle to the Laodiceans, with which he can hardly
have been unacquainted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Occurrence in <span class='fss'>MSS</span> of all ages and countries.</div>

<p class='c000'>Indeed the safest criterion of the extent to which this opinion prevailed,
is to be found in the manuscripts. At all ages from the sixth to the
fifteenth century we have examples of its occurrence among the Pauline
Epistles and most frequently without any marks which imply doubt respecting
its canonicity. These instances are more common in proportion to
the number of extant <span class='fss'>MSS</span> in the earlier epoch than in the later<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c016'><sup>[649]</sup></a>. In one
of the three or four extant authorities for the Old Latin Version of the
Pauline Epistles it has a place<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c016'><sup>[650]</sup></a>. In one of the two most ancient copies of
Jerome’s revised Vulgate it is found<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c016'><sup>[651]</sup></a>. Among the first class <span class='fss'>MSS</span> of
this latter Version its insertion is almost as common as its omission. This
phenomenon moreover is not confined to any one country. Italy, Spain,
France, Ireland, England, Germany, Switzerland—all the great nations of
Latin Christendom—contribute examples of early manuscripts in which
this epistle has a place<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c016'><sup>[652]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Revival of learning and condemnation of the epistle.</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus for more than nine centuries this forged epistle hovered about
the doors of the sacred Canon, without either finding admission or being
peremptorily excluded. At length the revival of learning dealt its death-blow
to this as to so many other spurious pretensions. As a rule, Roman
Catholics and Reformers were equally strong in their condemnation of its
worthlessness. The language of Erasmus more especially is worth quoting
for its own sake, and must not be diluted by translation:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strictures of Erasmus.</div>

by the Apostle himself or by some other Apostolic man’: he declares
that to himself it is ‘redolent of the spirit and grace of the most divine
Paul’; and he recommends younger teachers of the Gospel to ‘try their
strength in explaining it’, that thus ‘accustoming themselves gradually
to the Apostolic doctrine they may extract thence a flavour sweeter than

as showing that the Church had authority to exclude even Apostolic
writings from the Canon, if she judged fit<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c016'><sup>[661]</sup></a>. But such phenomena were
quite abnormal. The dawn of the Reformation epoch had effectually
scared away this ghost of a Pauline epistle, which (we may confidently
hope) has been laid for ever and will not again be suffered to haunt
the mind of the Church.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>EPISTLE TO PHILEMON.</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>
<h3 class='c019'>INTRODUCTION TO THE EPISTLE.</h3>
</div>

<div class='sidenote c002'>Unique character of the epistle.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Epistle to Philemon holds a unique place among the
Apostle’s writings. It is the only strictly private letter
which has been preserved. The Pastoral Epistles indeed are
addressed to individuals, but they discuss important matters
of Church discipline and government. Evidently they were
intended to be read by others besides those to whom they
are immediately addressed. On the other hand the letter
before us does not once touch upon any question of public
interest. It is addressed apparently to a layman. It is wholly
occupied with an incident of domestic life. The occasion
which called it forth was altogether common-place. It is only
one sample of numberless letters which must have been written
to his many friends and disciples by one of St Paul’s
eager temperament and warm affections, in the course of a
long and chequered life. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its value.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Yet to ourselves this fragment, which
has been rescued, we know not how, from the wreck of a large
and varied correspondence, is infinitely precious. Nowhere is
the social influence of the Gospel more strikingly exerted;
nowhere does the nobility of the Apostle’s character receive
a more vivid illustration than in this accidental pleading on
behalf of a runaway slave.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The persons addressed.</div>

<p class='c000'>The letter introduces us to an ordinary household  in  a
small town of Phrygia. Four members of it are mentioned
by name, the father, the mother, the son, and the slave.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. Philemon.</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The head of the family bears a name which, for good or
for evil, was not unknown in connexion with Phrygian story.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Occurrence of the name in Phrygia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The legend of Philemon and Baucis, the aged peasants who
entertained not angels but gods unawares, and were rewarded
by their divine guests for their homely hospitality and their
conjugal love<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c016'><sup>[662]</sup></a>, is one of the most attractive in Greek mythology,
and contrasts favourably with many a revolting tale in
which the powers of Olympus are represented as visiting this
lower earth. It has a special interest too for the Apostolic history,
because it suggests an explanation of the scene at Lystra,
when the barbarians would have sacrificed to the Apostles,
imagining that the same two gods, Zeus and Hermes, had once
again deigned to visit, in the likeness of men, those regions
which they had graced of old by their presence<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c016'><sup>[663]</sup></a>. Again, in
historical times we read of one Philemon who obtained an
unenviable notoriety at Athens by assuming the rights of
Athenian citizenship, though a Phrygian and apparently a
slave<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c016'><sup>[664]</sup></a>. Otherwise the name is not distinctively Phrygian. It
does not occur with any special frequency in the inscriptions
belonging to this country; and though several persons bearing
this name rose to eminence in literary history, not one, so far
as we know, was a Phrygian.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>This Philemon a Colossian</div>

<p class='c000'>The Philemon with whom we are concerned was a native,
or at least an inhabitant, of Colossæ. This appears from the
fact that his slave is mentioned as belonging to that place. It
may be added also, in confirmation of this view, that in one of
two epistles written and despatched at the same time St Paul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>announces the restoration of Onesimus to his master, while in
the other he speaks of this same person as revisiting Colossæ<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c016'><sup>[665]</sup></a>.
On the other hand it would not be safe to lay any stress on
the statement of Theodoret, that Philemon’s house was still
standing at Colossæ when he wrote<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c016'><sup>[666]</sup></a>, for traditions of this kind
have seldom any historical worth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>converted by St Paul.</div>

<p class='c000'>Philemon had been converted by St Paul himself<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c016'><sup>[667]</sup></a>. At
what time or under what circumstances he received his first
lessons in the Gospel, we do not know: but the Apostle’s long
residence at Ephesus naturally suggests itself as the period
when he was most likely to have become acquainted with a
citizen of Colossæ<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c016'><sup>[668]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His evangelical zeal,</div>

<p class='c000'>Philemon proved not unworthy of his spiritual parentage.
Though to Epaphras belongs the chief glory of preaching the
Gospel at Colossæ<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c016'><sup>[669]</sup></a>, his labours were well seconded by Philemon.
The title of ‘fellow-labourer,’ conferred upon him by
the Apostle<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c016'><sup>[670]</sup></a>, is a noble testimony to his evangelical zeal. Like
Nymphas in the neighbouring Church of Laodicea<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c016'><sup>[671]</sup></a>, Philemon
had placed his house at the disposal of the Christians at Colossæ
for their religious and social gatherings<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c016'><sup>[672]</sup></a>. Like Gaius<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c016'><sup>[673]</sup></a>, to
whom the only other private letter in the Apostolic Canon is
addressed<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c016'><sup>[674]</sup></a>, he was generous in his hospitalities. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and wide hospitality.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>All those
with whom he came in contact spoke with gratitude of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>kindly attentions<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c016'><sup>[675]</sup></a>. Of his subsequent career we have no certain
knowledge. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Legendary martyrdom.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Legendary story indeed promotes him to the
bishopric of Colossæ<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c016'><sup>[676]</sup></a>, and records how he was martyred in his
native city under Nero<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c016'><sup>[677]</sup></a>. But this tradition or fiction is not
entitled to any credit. All that we really know of Philemon is
contained within this epistle itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Apphia his wife.</div>

<p class='c000'>2. It is a safe inference from the connexion of the names
that Apphia was the wife of Philemon<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c016'><sup>[678]</sup></a>. The commentators
assume without misgiving that we have here the familiar
Roman name Appia, though they do not explain the intrusion
of the aspirate<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c016'><sup>[679]</sup></a>. This seems to be a mistake. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A strictly Phrygian name.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The word occurs
very frequently on Phrygian inscriptions as a proper name, and
is doubtless of native origin. At Aphrodisias and Philadelphia,
at Eumenia and Apamea Cibotus, at Stratonicea, at Philomelium,
at Æzani and Cotiæum and Dorylæum, at almost all
the towns far and near, which were either Phrygian or subject
to Phrygian influences, and in which any fair number of inscriptions
has been preserved, the name is found. If no example
has been discovered at Colossæ itself, we must remember that
not a single proper name has been preserved on any monumental
inscription at this place. It is generally written either
Apphia or Aphphia<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c016'><sup>[680]</sup></a>; more rarely Aphia, which is perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>due merely to the carelessness of the stonecutters<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c016'><sup>[681]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its affinities<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But, so far
as I have observed, it always preserves the aspirate. Its diminutive
is Apphion or Aphphion or Aphion<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c016'><sup>[682]</sup></a>. The allied form
Aphphias or Aphias, also a woman’s name, is found, though
less commonly<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c016'><sup>[683]</sup></a>; and we likewise frequently meet with the
shorter form Apphe or Aphphe<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c016'><sup>[684]</sup></a>. The man’s name corresponding
to Apphia is Apphianos, but this is rare<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c016'><sup>[685]</sup></a>. The root would
appear to be some Phrygian term of endearment or relationship<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c016'><sup>[686]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and analogies.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>It occurs commonly in connexion with other Phrygian
names of a like stamp, more especially Ammia, which undergoes
the same modifications of form, Amia, Ammias, Ammion
or Amion, Ammiane or Ammiana, with the corresponding
masculine Ammianos<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c016'><sup>[687]</sup></a>. With these we may also compare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Tatia, Tatias, Tation, Tatiane or Tatiana, Tatianos. Similar
too is the name Papias or Pappias, with the lengthened form
Papianos, to which corresponds the feminine Papiane<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c016'><sup>[688]</sup></a>. So
again we have Nannas or Nanas, Nanna or Nana, with their
derivatives, in these Phrygian inscriptions<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c016'><sup>[689]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Not to be confused with the Latin Appia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>There is a tendency
in some of the allied forms of Apphia or Aphphia to drop
the aspirate so that they are written with a <em>pp</em>, more especially
in Appe<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c016'><sup>[690]</sup></a>, but not in the word itself; nor have I observed conversely
any disposition to write the Roman name Appia with an
aspirate, Apphia or Aphphia<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c016'><sup>[691]</sup></a>. Even if such a disposition could
be proved, the main point for which I am contending can
hardly be questioned. With the overwhelming evidence of the
inscriptions before us, it is impossible to doubt that Apphia is
a native Phrygian name<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c016'><sup>[692]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Her share in the letter.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of this Phrygian matron we know nothing more than can
be learnt from this epistle. The tradition or fiction which
represents her as martyred together with her husband may be
safely disregarded. St Paul addresses her as a Christian<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c016'><sup>[693]</sup></a>.
Equally with her husband she had been aggrieved by the misconduct
of their slave Onesimus, and equally with him she
might interest herself in the penitent’s future well-being.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3. Archippus, the son.</div>

<p class='c000'>3. With less confidence, but still with a reasonable degree
of probability, we may infer that Archippus, who is likewise
mentioned in the opening salutation, was a son<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c016'><sup>[694]</sup></a> of Philemon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>and Apphia. The inscriptions do not exhibit the name in
any such frequency either in Phrygia or in the surrounding districts,
as to suggest that it was characteristic of these parts<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c016'><sup>[695]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>His office<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Our Archippus held some important office in the Church<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c016'><sup>[696]</sup></a>;
but what this was, we are not told. St Paul speaks of it as
a ‘ministry’ (διακονία). Some have interpreted the term technically
as signifying the diaconate; but St Paul’s emphatic
message seems to imply a more important position than this.
Others again suppose that he succeeded Epaphras as bishop of
Colossæ, when Epaphras left his native city to join the Apostle
at Rome<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c016'><sup>[697]</sup></a>; but the assumption of a regular and continuous
episcopate in such a place as Colossæ at this date seems to
involve an anachronism. More probable than either is the
hypothesis which makes him a presbyter. Or perhaps he held
a missionary charge, and belonged to the order of ‘evangelists<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c016'><sup>[698]</sup></a>.’
Another question too arises respecting Archippus.
Where was he exercising this ministry, whatever it may have
been? At Colossæ, or at Laodicea? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and abode,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>His connexion with Philemon
would suggest the former place. But in the Epistle
to the Colossians his name is mentioned immediately after the
salutations to the Laodiceans and the directions affecting that
Church; and this fact seems to connect him with Laodicea.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Laodicea, rather than Colossæ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>On the whole this appears to be the more probable solution<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c016'><sup>[699]</sup></a>.
Laodicea was within walking distance of Colossæ<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c016'><sup>[700]</sup></a>. Archippus
must have been in constant communication with his parents,
who lived there; and it was therefore quite natural that,
writing to the father and mother, St Paul should mention the
son’s name also in the opening address, though he was not
on the spot. An early tradition, if it be not a critical inference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>from the allusion in the Colossian letter, makes him
bishop not of Colossæ, but of Laodicea<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c016'><sup>[701]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His career.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the apprehensions which the Apostle seems to have
entertained respecting Archippus, I have already spoken<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c016'><sup>[702]</sup></a>. It
is not improbable that they were suggested by his youth and
inexperience. St Paul here addresses him as his ‘fellow-soldier<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c016'><sup>[703]</sup></a>,’
but we are not informed on what spiritual campaigns
they had served in company. Of his subsequent career we
have no trustworthy evidence. Tradition represents him as
having suffered martyrdom at Colossæ with his father and
mother.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>4. Onesimus.</div>

<p class='c000'>4. But far more important to the history of Christianity
than the parents or the son of the family, is the servant. The
name Onesimus was very commonly borne by slaves. Like
other words signifying utility, worth, and so forth, it naturally
lent itself to this purpose<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c016'><sup>[704]</sup></a>. Accordingly the inscriptions offer
a very large number of examples in which it appears as the
name of some slave or freedman<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c016'><sup>[705]</sup></a>; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A servile name.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>and even where this is
not the case, the accompaniments frequently show that the
person was of servile descent, though he might never himself
have been a slave<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c016'><sup>[706]</sup></a>. Indeed it occurs more than once as a
fictitious name for a slave<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c016'><sup>[707]</sup></a>, a fact which points significantly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>the social condition naturally suggested by it. In the inscriptions
of proconsular Asia it is found<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c016'><sup>[708]</sup></a>; but no stress can be laid
on this coincidence, for its occurrence as a proper name was
doubtless coextensive with the use of the Greek language.
More important is the fact that in the early history of Christianity
it attains some eminence in this region. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its prominence among the Christians of proconsular Asia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>One Onesimus
is bishop of Ephesus in the first years of the second century,
when Ignatius passes through Asia Minor on his way to martyrdom,
and is mentioned by the saint in terms of warm affection
and respect<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c016'><sup>[709]</sup></a>. Another, apparently an influential layman,
about half a century later urges Melito bishop of Sardis to compile
a volume of extracts from the scriptures; and to him this
father dedicates the work when completed<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c016'><sup>[710]</sup></a>. Thus it would
appear that the memory of the Colossian slave had invested
the name with a special popularity among Christians in this
district.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Position and conduct of Onesimus.</div>

<p class='c000'>Onesimus represented the least respectable type of the least
respectable class in the social scale. He was regarded by philosophers
as a ‘live chattel’, a ‘live implement<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c016'><sup>[711]</sup></a>’; and he had
taken philosophy at her word. He had done what a chattel or
an implement might be expected to do, if endued with life and
intelligence. He was treated by the law as having no rights<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c016'><sup>[712]</sup></a>;
and he had carried the principles of the law to their logical consequences.
He had declined to entertain any responsibilities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>There was absolutely nothing to recommend him. He was a
slave, and what was worse, a Phrygian slave; and he had
confirmed the popular estimate of his class<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c016'><sup>[713]</sup></a> and nation<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c016'><sup>[714]</sup></a> by
his own conduct. He was a thief and a runaway. His offence
did not differ in any way, so far as we know, from the vulgar
type of slavish offences. He seems to have done just what
the representative slave in the Roman comedy threatens to do,
when he gets into trouble. He had ‘packed up some goods
and taken to his heels<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c016'><sup>[715]</sup></a>.’ Rome was the natural cesspool for
these offscourings of humanity<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c016'><sup>[716]</sup></a>. In the thronging crowds of
the metropolis was his best hope of secresy. In the dregs of
the city rabble he would find the society of congenial spirits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His encounter with St Paul in Rome</div>

<p class='c000'>But at Rome the Apostle spread his net for him, and he
was caught in its meshes. How he first came in contact with
the imprisoned missionary, we can only conjecture. Was it an
accidental encounter with his fellow-townsman Epaphras in the
streets of Rome which led to the interview? Was it the
pressure of want which induced him to seek alms from one
whose large-hearted charity must have been a household word
in his master’s family? Or did the memory of solemn words,
which he had chanced to overhear at those weekly gatherings
in the upper chamber at Colossæ, haunt him in his
loneliness, till, yielding to the fascination, he was constrained
to unburden himself to the one man who could soothe his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>terrors and satisfy his yearnings?  Whatever motive may
have drawn him to the Apostle’s side—whether the pangs
of hunger or the gnawings of conscience—when he was once
within the range of attraction, he could not escape. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and conversion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>He
listened, was impressed, was convinced, was baptized. The
slave of Philemon became the freedman of Christ<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c016'><sup>[717]</sup></a>. St Paul
found not only a sincere convert, but a devoted friend, in his
latest son in the faith. Aristotle had said that there ought
not to be, and could not be, any friendship with a slave <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>qua</em></span>
slave, though there might be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>qua</em></span> man<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c016'><sup>[718]</sup></a>; and others had held
still stronger language to the same effect. The Apostle did
not recognize the philosopher’s subtle distinction. For him
the conventional barrier between slave and free had altogether
vanished before the dissolving presence of an eternal verity<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c016'><sup>[719]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>St Paul’s affection for him.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>He found in Onesimus something more than a slave, a beloved
brother both as a slave and as a man, ‘both in the flesh and in
the Lord<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c016'><sup>[720]</sup></a>.’ The great capacity for good which appears in the
typical slave of Greek and Roman fiction, notwithstanding all
the fraud and profligacy overlying it, was evoked and developed
here by the inspiration of a new faith and the incentive of a
new hope. The genial, affectionate, winning disposition, purified
and elevated by a higher knowledge, had found its proper
scope. Altogether this new friendship was a solace and a
strength to the Apostle in his weary captivity, which he could
ill afford to forego. To take away Onesimus was to tear out
Paul’s heart<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c016'><sup>[721]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Necessity for his return</div>

<p class='c000'>But there was an imperious demand for the sacrifice. Onesimus
had repented, but he had not made restitution. He
could only do this by submitting again to the servitude from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>which he had escaped. Philemon must be made to feel that,
when Onesimus was gained for Christ, he was regained for
his old master also. But if the claim of duty demanded a great
sacrifice from Paul, it demanded a greater still from Onesimus.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>notwithstanding the risk.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>By returning he would place himself entirely at the mercy of the
master whom he had wronged. Roman law, more cruel than
Athenian, practically imposed no limits to the power of the
master over his slave<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c016'><sup>[722]</sup></a>. The alternative of life or death rested
solely with Philemon, and slaves were constantly crucified for
far lighter offences than his<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c016'><sup>[723]</sup></a>. A thief and a runaway, he laid
no claim to forgiveness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mediation of Tychicus</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>supplemented by the Apostle’s letter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c000'>A favourable opportunity occurred for restoring Onesimus
to his master. Tychicus, as the bearer of letters from the
Apostle to Laodicea and Colossæ, had occasion to visit those
parts. He might undertake the office of mediator, and plead
the cause of the penitent slave with the offended master.
Under his shelter Onesimus would be safer than if he encountered
Philemon alone. But St Paul is not satisfied with
this precaution. He will with his own hand write a few words
of eager affectionate entreaty, identifying himself with the
cause of Onesimus. So he takes up his pen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Analysis of the letter.</div>

<p class='c000'>After the opening salutation to Philemon and the members
of his family, he expresses his thankfulness for the report which
has reached his ears of his friend’s charitable deeds. It is a
great joy and encouragement to the Apostle that so many
brethren have had cause to bless his name. This wide-spread
reputation for kindliness emboldens him to reveal his object in
writing. Though he has a right to command, he prefers rather
to entreat. He has a petition to prefer on behalf of a child of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>his own. This is none other than Onesimus, whom Philemon
will remember only as a worthless creature, altogether untrue
to his name, but who now is a reformed man. He would have
wished to detain Onesimus, for he can ill afford to dispense
with his loving services. Indeed Philemon would doubtless have
been glad thus to minister vicariously to the Apostle’s wants.
But a benefit which wears the appearance of being forced,
whether truly so or not, loses all its value, and therefore he
sends him back. Nay, there may have been in this desertion a
Divine providence which it would ill become him Paul to thwart.
Onesimus may have been withheld from Philemon for a time,
that he might be restored to him for ever. He may have left as
a slave, that he might return more than a slave. To others—to
the Apostle himself especially—he is now a dearly beloved
brother. Must he not be this and more than this to Philemon,
whether in earthly things or in heavenly things? He therefore
begs Philemon to receive Onesimus as he would receive himself.
As for any injury that he may have done, as for any money that
he may owe, the Apostle makes himself responsible for this.
The present letter may be accepted as a bond, a security for
repayment. Yet at the same time he cannot refrain from
reminding Philemon that he might fairly claim the remission of
so small an amount. Does not his friend owe to him his own
soul besides? Yes, he has a right to look for some filial gratitude
and duty from one to whom he stands in the relation of a
spiritual father. Philemon will surely not refuse him this comfort
in his many trials. He writes in the full confidence that
he will be obeyed; he is quite sure that his friend will do more
than is asked of him. At the same time he trusts to see him
before very long, and to talk over this and other matters.
Philemon may provide him a lodging: for he hopes through
their prayers that he may be liberated, and given back to them.
Then follow the salutations, and the letter ends with the
Apostle’s benediction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Result of the appeal.</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the result of this appeal we have no certain knowledge.
It is reasonable to suppose however that Philemon would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>belie the Apostle’s hopes; that he would receive the slave as a
brother; that he would even go beyond the expressed terms of
the Apostle’s petition, and emancipate the penitent. But all
this is a mere conjecture. One tradition makes Onesimus bishop
of Ephesus<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c016'><sup>[724]</sup></a>. But this obviously arises from a confusion with
his namesake, who lived about half a century later<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c016'><sup>[725]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Legendary history.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Another
story points to Ber&oelig;a in Macedonia as his see<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c016'><sup>[726]</sup></a>. This is at least
free from the suspicion of having been suggested by any notice
in the Apostolic writings: but the authority on which it rests
does not entitle it to much credit. The legend of his missionary
labours in Spain and of his martyrdom at Rome may have been
built on the hypothesis of his continuing in the Apostle’s
company, following in the Apostle’s footsteps, and sharing the
Apostle’s fate. Another story, which gives a circumstantial
account of his martyrdom at Puteoli, seems to confuse him with
a namesake who suffered, or was related to have suffered, in the
Decian persecution<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c016'><sup>[727]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Depreciation of the epistle in early times.</div>

<p class='c000'>The estimate formed of this epistle at various epochs has
differed widely. In the fourth century there was a strong bias
against it. The ‘spirit of the age’ had no sympathy with either
the subject or the handling. Like the spirit of more than one
later age, it was enamoured of its own narrowness, which it
mistook for largeness of view, and it could not condescend to
such trivialities as were here offered to it. Its maxim seemed
to be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>De minimis non curat evangelium</em></span>. Of what account was
the fate of a single insignificant slave, long since dead and gone,
to those before whose eyes the battle of the creeds was still
raging? This letter taught them nothing about questions of
theological interest, nothing about matters of ecclesiastical discipline;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>and therefore they would have none of it. They denied
that it had been written by St Paul. It mattered nothing to
them that the Church from the earliest ages had accepted it as
genuine, that even the remorseless ‘higher criticism’ of a
Marcion had not ventured to lay hands on it<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c016'><sup>[728]</sup></a>. It was wholly
unworthy of the Apostle. If written by him, they contended,
it must have been written when he was not under the influence
of the Spirit: its contents were altogether so unedifying. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Reply of the fathers.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>We
may infer from the replies of Jerome<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c016'><sup>[729]</sup></a>, of Chrysostom<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c016'><sup>[730]</sup></a>, and of
Theodore of Mopsuestia<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c016'><sup>[731]</sup></a>, that they felt themselves to be
stemming a fierce current of prejudice which had set in this
direction. But they were strong in the excellence of their
cause, and they nobly vindicated this epistle against its
assailants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>High estimate of modern writers.</div>

<p class='c000'>In modern times there has been no disposition to under-rate
its value. Even Luther and Calvin, whose bias tended to the
depreciation of the ethical as compared with the doctrinal
portions of the scriptures, show a true appreciation of its beauty
and significance. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Luther.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>‘This epistle’, writes Luther, ‘showeth a
right noble lovely example of Christian love. Here we see how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>St Paul layeth himself out for poor Onesimus, and with all his
means pleadeth his cause with his master: and so setteth
himself as if he were Onesimus, and had himself done wrong
to Philemon. Even as Christ did for us with God the Father,
thus also doth St Paul for Onesimus with Philemon.... We are all
his Onesimi, to my thinking’. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Calvin.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>‘Though he handleth a subject’,
says Calvin, ‘which otherwise were low and mean, yet after his
manner he is borne up aloft unto God. With such modest
entreaty doth he humble himself on behalf of the lowest of men,
that scarce anywhere else is the gentleness of his spirit portrayed
more truly to the life.’ And the chorus of admiration
has been swelled by later voices from the most opposite quarters.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Later writers.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>‘The single Epistle to Philemon,’ says one quoted by Bengel,
‘very far surpasses all the wisdom of the world’<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c016'><sup>[732]</sup></a>. ‘Nowhere’,
writes Ewald, ‘can the sensibility and warmth of a tender friendship
blend more beautifully with the loftier feeling of a
commanding spirit, a teacher and an Apostle, than in this
letter, at once so brief, and yet so surpassingly full and significant<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c016'><sup>[733]</sup></a>.’
‘A true little <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’&oelig;uvre</span> of the art of letter-writing,’
exclaims M. Renan characteristically<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c016'><sup>[734]</sup></a>. ‘We have here’, writes
Sabatier, ‘only a few familiar lines, but so full of grace, of
salt, of serious and trustful affection, that this short epistle
gleams like a pearl of the most exquisite purity in the rich
treasure of the New Testament<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c016'><sup>[735]</sup></a>’. Even Baur, while laying
violent hands upon it, is constrained to speak of this ‘little letter’
as ‘making such an agreeable impression by its attractive form’
and as penetrated ‘with the noblest Christian spirit’<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c016'><sup>[736]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The epistle compared with a letter of Pliny,</div>

<p class='c000'>The Epistle to Philemon has more than once been compared
with the following letter addressed to a friend by the
younger Pliny on a somewhat similar occasion<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c016'><sup>[737]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c021'>Your freedman, with whom you had told me you were vexed,
came to me, and throwing himself down before me clung to my feet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>as if they had been yours. He was profuse in his tears and his
entreaties; he was profuse also in his silence. In short, he convinced
me of his penitence. I believe that he is indeed a reformed
character, because he feels that he has done wrong. You are angry,
I know; and you have reason to be angry, this also I know: but
mercy wins the highest praise just when there is the most righteous
cause for anger. You loved the man, and, I hope, will continue to
love him: meanwhile it is enough, that you should allow yourself
to yield to his prayers. You may be angry again, if he deserves it;
and in this you will be the more readily pardoned if you yield now.
Concede something to his youth, something to his tears, something
to your own indulgent disposition. Do not torture him, lest you
torture yourself at the same time. For it <em>is</em> torture to you, when one
of your gentle temper is angry. I am afraid lest I should appear not
to ask but to compel, if I should add my prayers to his. Yet I will
add them the more fully and unreservedly, because I scolded the man
himself with sharpness and severity; for I threatened him straitly
that I would never ask you again. This I said to him, for it was
necessary to alarm him; but I do not use the same language to you.
For perchance I shall ask again, and shall be successful again; only
let my request be such, as it becomes me to prefer and you to grant.
Farewell.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>as an expression of character.</div>

<p class='c000'>The younger Pliny is the noblest type of a true Roman
gentleman, and this touching letter needs no words of praise.
Yet, if purity of diction be excepted, there will hardly be any
difference of opinion in awarding the palm to the Christian
Apostle. As an expression of simple dignity, of refined courtesy,
of large sympathy, and of warm personal affection, the Epistle
to Philemon stands unrivalled. And its pre-eminence is the
more remarkable because in style it is exceptionally loose. It
owes nothing to the graces of rhetoric; its effect is due solely
to the spirit of the writer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its higher interest.</div>

<p class='c000'>But the interest which attaches to this short epistle as
an expression of individual character is far less important than
its significance as exhibiting the attitude of Christianity to a
widely spread and characteristic social institution of the ancient
world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slavery among the Hebrews.</div>

<p class='c000'>Slavery was practised by the Hebrews under the sanction
of the Mosaic law, not less than by the Greeks and Romans.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>But though the same in name, it was in its actual working
something wholly different. The Hebrew was not suffered either
by law-giver or by prophet to forget that he himself had been
a bondman in the land of Egypt; and all his relations to his
dependents were moulded by the sympathy of this recollection.
His slaves were members of his family; they were members
also of the Holy Congregation. They had their religious, as
well as their social, rights. If Hebrews, their liberty was
secured to them after six years’ service at the outside. If
foreigners, they were protected by the laws from the tyranny
and violence of their masters. Considering the conditions of
ancient society, and more especially of ancient warfare, slavery
as practised among the Hebrews was probably an escape from
alternatives which would have involved a far greater amount of
human misery. Still even in this form it was only a temporary
concession, till the fulness of time came, and the world was
taught that ‘in Christ is neither bond nor free<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c016'><sup>[738]</sup></a>’.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Jews the slaves formed only a small fraction of
the whole population<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c016'><sup>[739]</sup></a>. They occupy a very insignificant place
in the pictures of Hebrew life and history which have been
handed down to us. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Large number of slaves in Greece and Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But in Greece and Rome the case was far
different. In our enthusiastic eulogies of free, enlightened,
democratic Athens, we are apt to forget that the interests
of the many were ruthlessly sacrificed to the selfishness of the
few. The slaves of Attica on the most probable computation
were about four times as numerous as the citizens, and about
three times as numerous as the whole free population of the
state, including the resident aliens<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c016'><sup>[740]</sup></a>. They were consigned for
the most part to labour in gangs in the fields or the mines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>or the factories, without any hope of bettering their condition.
In the light of these facts we see what was really meant by
popular government and equal rights at Athens. The proportions
of the slave population elsewhere were even greater. In
the small island of Ægina, scarcely exceeding forty English
square miles in extent, there were 470,000 slaves; in the contracted
territory of Corinth there were not less than 460,000<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c016'><sup>[741]</sup></a>.
The statistics of slave-holding in Italy are quite as startling.
We are told that wealthy Roman landowners sometimes possessed
as many as ten or twenty thousand slaves, or even more<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c016'><sup>[742]</sup></a>.
We may indeed not unreasonably view these vague and general
statements with suspicion: but it is a fact that, a few years
before the Christian era, one Claudius Isidorus left by will
more than four thousand slaves, though he had incurred serious
losses by the civil war<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c016'><sup>[743]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruelty of Roman law towards slaves.</div>

<p class='c000'>And these vast masses of human beings had no protection
from Roman law<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c016'><sup>[744]</sup></a>. The slave had no relationships, no conjugal
rights. Cohabitation was allowed to him at his owner’s
pleasure, but not marriage. His companion was sometimes assigned
to him by lot<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c016'><sup>[745]</sup></a>. The slave was absolutely at his master’s
disposal; for the smallest offence he might be scourged, mutilated,
crucified, thrown to the wild beasts<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c016'><sup>[746]</sup></a>. Only two or three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>years before the letter to Philemon was written, and probably
during St Paul’s residence in Rome, a terrible tragedy had
been enacted under the sanction of the law<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c016'><sup>[747]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Murder of Pedanius Secundus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Pedanius Secundus,
a senator, had been slain by one of his slaves in a fit of
anger or jealousy. The law demanded that in such cases all
the slaves under the same roof at the time should be put
to death. On the present occasion four hundred persons were
condemned to suffer by this inhuman enactment. The populace
however interposed to rescue them, and a tumult ensued.
The Senate accordingly took the matter into deliberation.
Among the speakers C. Cassius strongly advocated the enforcement
of the law. ‘The disposition of slaves,’ he argued, ‘were
regarded with suspicion by our ancestors, even when they were
born on the same estates or in the same houses and learnt
to feel an affection for their masters from the first. Now however,
when we have several nations among our slaves, with
various rites, with foreign religions or none at all, it is not possible
to keep down such a rabble except by fear.’ These sentiments
prevailed, and the law was put in force. But the roads
were lined by a military guard, as the prisoners were led to
execution, to prevent a popular outbreak. This incident illustrates
not only the heartless cruelty of the law, but also the
social dangers arising out of slavery. Indeed the universal
distrust had already found expression in a common proverb,‘As
many enemies as slaves<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c016'><sup>[748]</sup></a>.’ But this was not the only way in
which slavery avenged itself on the Romans. The spread of
luxury and idleness was a direct consequence of the state of
things. Work came to be regarded as a low and degrading,
because a servile occupation. Meanwhile sensuality in its vilest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>forms was fostered by the tremendous power which placed the
slave at the mercy of the master’s worst passions<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c016'><sup>[749]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Christianity not revolutionary.</div>

<p class='c000'>With this wide-spread institution Christianity found itself
in conflict. How was the evil to be met? Slavery was inwoven
into the texture of society; and to prohibit slavery was
to tear society into shreds. Nothing less than a servile war
with its certain horrors and its doubtful issues must have been
the consequence. Such a mode of operation was altogether
alien to the spirit of the Gospel. ‘The New Testament’, it
has been truly said, ‘is not concerned with any political or
social institutions; for political and social institutions belong
to particular nations and particular phases of society’. ‘Nothing
marks the divine character of the Gospel more than its
perfect freedom from any appeal to the spirit of political revolution<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c016'><sup>[750]</sup></a>’.
It belongs to all time: and therefore, instead of
attacking special abuses, it lays down universal principles
which shall undermine the evil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St Paul’s treatment of the case of Onesimus.</div>

<p class='c000'>Hence the Gospel never directly attacks slavery as an institution:
the Apostles never command the liberation of slaves as
an absolute duty. It is a remarkable fact that St Paul in this
epistle stops short of any positive injunction. The word
‘emancipation’ seems to be trembling on his lips, and yet he
does not once utter it. He charges Philemon to take the runaway
slave Onesimus into his confidence again; to receive him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>with all affection; to regard him no more as a slave but as a
brother; to treat him with the same consideration, the same
love, which he entertains for the Apostle himself to whom he
owes everything. In fact he tells him to do very much more
than emancipate his slave, but this one thing he does not
directly enjoin. St Paul’s treatment of this individual case
is an apt illustration of the attitude of Christianity towards
slavery in general.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His language respecting slavery elsewhere.</div>

<p class='c000'>Similar also is his language elsewhere. Writing to the
Corinthians, he declares the absolute equality of the freeman
and the slave in the sight of God<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c016'><sup>[751]</sup></a>. It follows therefore that
the slave may cheerfully acquiesce in his lot, knowing that all
earthly distinctions vanish in the light of this eternal truth.
If his freedom should be offered to him, he will do well to
accept it, for it puts him in a more advantageous position<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c016'><sup>[752]</sup></a>: but
meanwhile he need not give himself any concern about his lot
in life. So again, when he addresses the Ephesians and Colossians
on the mutual obligations of masters and slaves, he is
content to insist on the broad fact that both alike are slaves of
a heavenly Master, and to enforce the duties which flow from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>its recognition<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c016'><sup>[753]</sup></a>. He has no word of reproach for the masters
on the injustice of their position; he breathes no hint to the
slaves of a social grievance needing redress.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Christian idea fatal to slavery.</div>

<p class='c000'>But meanwhile a principle is boldly enunciated, which must
in the end prove fatal to slavery. When the Gospel taught
that God had made all men and women upon earth of one
family; that all alike were His sons and His daughters; that,
whatever conventional distinctions human society might set
up, the supreme King of Heaven refused to acknowledge any;
that the slave notwithstanding his slavery was Christ’s freedman,
and the free notwithstanding his liberty was Christ’s
slave; when the Church carried out this principle by admitting
the slave to her highest privileges, inviting him to kneel side
by side with his master at the same holy table; when in short
the Apostolic precept that ‘in Christ Jesus is neither bond nor
free’ was not only recognised but acted upon, then slavery was
doomed. Henceforward it was only a question of time. Here
was the idea which must act as a solvent, must disintegrate
this venerable institution, however deeply rooted and however
widely spread. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Its general tendency.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>‘The brotherhood of man, in short, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>idea which Christianity in its social phase has been always
striving to realise, and the progress of which constitutes the
social history of Christendom. With what difficulties this idea
has struggled; how it has been marred by revolutionary violence,
as well as impeded by reactionary selfishness; to what chimerical
hopes, to what wild schemes, to what calamitous disappointments,
to what desperate conflicts, it has given birth; how often
being misunderstood and misapplied, it has brought not peace
on earth but a sword—it is needless here to rehearse. Still, as
we look back over the range of past history, we can see beyond
doubt that it is towards this goal that Christianity as a social
principle has been always tending and still tends<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c016'><sup>[754]</sup></a>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its effects on slavery.</div>

<p class='c000'>And this beneficent tendency of the Gospel was felt at once
in its effects on slavery. The Church indeed, even in the
ardour of her earliest love, did not prohibit her sons from retaining
slaves in their households. It is quite plain from
extant notices, that in the earlier centuries, as in the later,
Christians owned slaves<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c016'><sup>[755]</sup></a> like their heathen neighbours, without
forfeiting consideration among their fellow-believers. But
nevertheless the Christian idea was not a dead-letter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Protection and manumission of slaves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The
chivalry of the Gospel which regarded the weak and helpless
from whatever cause, as its special charge, which extended its
protection to the widow, the orphan, the sick, the aged, and the
prisoner, was not likely to neglect the slave. Accordingly we
find that one of the earliest forms which Christian benevolence
took was the contribution of funds for the liberation of slaves<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c016'><sup>[756]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Honours paid to slave martyrs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>But even more important than overt acts like these was the
moral and social importance with which the slave was now invested.
Among the heroes and heroines of the Church were
found not a few members of this class. When slave girls like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Blandina in Gaul or Felicitas in Africa, having won for themselves
the crown of martyrdom, were celebrated in the festivals
of the Church with honours denied to the most powerful and
noblest born of mankind, social prejudice had received a wound
which could never be healed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Christianity predominant.</div>

<p class='c000'>While the Church was still kept in subjection, moral
influence and private enterprise were her only weapons. But
Christianity was no sooner seated on the throne of the Cæsars
than its influence began to be felt in the imperial policy<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c016'><sup>[757]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Legislation of Constantine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The
legislation of Constantine, despite its startling inequalities,
forms a unique chapter in the statute book of Rome. In its
mixed character indeed it reflects the transitional position of its
author. But after all allowance made for its very patent defects,
its general advance in the direction of humanity and purity
is far greater than can be traced in the legislation even of the
most humane and virtuous of his heathen predecessors. More
especially in the extension of legal protection to slaves, and in
the encouragement given to emancipation, we have an earnest
of the future work which Christianity was destined to do for
this oppressed class of mankind, though the relief which it
gave was after all very partial and tentative<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c016'><sup>[758]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Subsequent activity of the Church.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>And on the whole this part has been faithfully and courageously
performed by the Church. There have been shameful
exceptions now and then: there has been occasional timidity
and excess of caution. The commentaries of the fathers on
this epistle are an illustration of this latter fault<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c016'><sup>[759]</sup></a>. Much may
be pardoned to men who shrink from seeming to countenance a
violent social revolution. But notwithstanding, it is a broad
and patent fact that throughout the early and middle ages the
influence of the Church was exerted strongly on the side of
humanity in this matter<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c016'><sup>[760]</sup></a>. The emancipation of slaves was
regarded as a principal aim of the higher Christian life<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c016'><sup>[761]</sup></a>; the
amelioration of serfdom was a matter of constant solicitude
with the rulers of the Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The conquests and hopes of the present time.</div>

<p class='c000'>And at length we seem to see the beginning of the end. The
rapid strides towards emancipation during the present generation
are without a parallel in the history of the world. The abolition
of slavery throughout the British Empire at an enormous
material sacrifice is one of the greatest moral conquests which
England has ever achieved. The liberation of twenty millions of
serfs throughout the Russian dominions has thrown a halo of
glory round the name of Alexander II., which no time can dim.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>The emancipation of the negro in the vast republic of the New
World was a victory not less important than either to the well-being
of the human race. Thus within the short period of
little more than a quarter of a century this reproach of civilisation
and humanity has been wiped out in the three greatest
empires of the world. It is a fit sequel to these achievements,
that at length a well directed attack should have been made on
the central fortress of slavery and the slave-trade, the interior
of Africa. May we not venture to predict that in future ages,
when distance of view shall have adjusted the true relations of
events, when the brilliancy of empires and the fame of wars shall
have sunk to their proper level of significance, this epoch will
stand out in the history of mankind as the era of liberation?
If so, the Epistle to Philemon, as the earliest prelude to these
magnificent social victories, must be invested with more than
common interest for our generation.</p>

and peace to you all from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.’</p>

<p class='c034'>1. δέσμιος] The authoritative title
of ‘Apostle’ is dropped, because
throughout this letter St Paul desires
to entreat rather than to command
(ver. 8, 9); see the note on Phil. i. 1.
In its place is substituted a designation
which would touch his friend’s
heart. How could Philemon resist
an appeal which was penned within
prison walls and by a manacled hand?
For this characteristic reference to
his ‘bonds’ see the note on ver. 13.</p>

<p class='c034'>Τιμόθεος] Timothy seems to have
been with St Paul during a great part
of his three years’ sojourn in Ephesus
(Acts xix. 22), and could hardly have
failed to make the acquaintance of
Philemon. For the designation ὁ
ἀδελφός applied to Timothy see the
note on Col. i. 1.</p>

<p class='c034'>Φιλήμονι κ.τ.λ.] On the persons
here addressed, and the language in
which they are described, see the introduction
p. 369 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>συνεργῷ] It would probably be
during St Paul’s long sojourn at Ephesus
that Philemon had laboured with
him: see above p. 31 sq.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἡμῶν] should probably be attached
to ἀγαπητῷ as well as to συνεργῷ;
comp. Rom. xvi. 5, 8, 9, 1 Cor. x. 14,
Phil. ii. 12.</p>

<p class='c034'>2. τῇ ἀδελφῇ] For this the received
text has τῇ ἀγαπητῇ. Internal
probabilities can be urged in favour
of both readings. On the one hand
ἀγαπητῇ might have been introduced
for the sake of conformity to the preceding
ἀγαπητῷ; on the other ἀδελφῇ
might have been substituted for ἀγαπητῇ
on grounds of false delicacy.
Theodore of Mopsuestia (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Spicil. Solesm.</cite></span>
<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 154), who had the reading
ἀγαπητῇ, feels an apology necessary:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Istius temporis</span> (i.e. of the present
time) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">homines propemodum omnes in
crimine vocandos esse existimant, modo

vero non sic sentiebat; sed

ἀδελφῇ, because the preponderance of
ancient authority is very decidedly in
its favour.</p>

<p class='c034'>συνστρατιώτῃ] These spiritual campaigns,
in which Archippus was his
comrade, probably took place while
St Paul was at Ephesus (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 54–57).
For the word συνστρατιώτης see Phil.
ii. 25. The metaphor of στρατεία,
στρατεύεσθαι, is common in St Paul.</p>

<p class='c034'>τῇ κατ’ οἶκον κ.τ.λ.] probably at Colossæ;

<p class='c033'>4–7. ‘I never cease to give thanks
to my God for thy well-doing, and thou
art ever mentioned in my prayers.
For they tell me of thy love and faith—thy
faith which thou hast in the
Lord Jesus, and thy love which thou
showest towards all the saints; and it
is my prayer that this active sympathy
and charity, thus springing from thy
faith, may abound more and more, as
thou attainest to the perfect knowledge
of every good thing bestowed
upon us by God, looking unto and
striving after Christ. For indeed it
gave me great joy and comfort to hear
of thy loving-kindness, and to learn
how the hearts of God’s people had
been cheered and refreshed by thy
help, my dear brother’.</p>

<p class='c034'>The Apostle’s thanksgiving and intercessory
prayer (ver. 4)—the cause
of his thanksgiving (ver. 5)—the purport
of his prayer (ver. 6)—the joy
and comfort which he has in Philemon’s
good deeds (ver. 7)—this is the
very simple order of topics in these
verses. But meanwhile all established
principles of arrangement are defied
in the anxiety to give expression to
the thought which is uppermost for
the moment. The clause ἀκούων κ.τ.λ.
is separated from εὐχαριστῶ κ.τ.λ., on
which it depends, by the intervening
clause μνείαν σου κ.τ.λ. which introduces
another thought. It itself interposes
between two clauses μνείαν
σου κ.τ.λ. and ὅπως ἡ κοινωνία κ.τ.λ.,
which stand in the closest logical and
grammatical connexion with each
other. Its own component elements
are dislocated and inverted in the
struggle of the several ideas for immediate
utterance. And lastly, in χαρὰν
γὰρ κ.τ.λ. there is again a recurrence
to a topic which has occurred
in an earlier part of the sentence (τὴν
ἀγάπην ... εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους) but
which has been dropped, before it was
exhausted, owing to the pressure of
another more importunate thought.</p>

<p class='c034'>4. Εὐχαριστῶ] See the note on
1 Thess. i. 2.</p>

<p class='c034'>πάντοτε] should probably be taken
with εὐχαριστῶ (rather than with
μνείαν κ.τ.λ.), according to St Paul’s
usual collocation in these opening
thanksgivings: see the notes on Col.
i. 3, Phil. i. 3.</p>

<p class='c034'>μνείαν σου κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>making mention
of thee</em>.’ For μνείαν ποιεῖσθαι see the
note on 1 Thess. i. 2. Here the ‘mention’
involves the idea of intercession
<em>on behalf of</em> Philemon, and so introduces
the ὅπως κ.τ.λ. of ver. 6. See
the note there.</p>

<p class='c034'>5. ἀκούων] This information would
probably come from Epaphras (Col. i.
7, 8, iv. 12) rather than from Onesimus.
The participle is connected
more directly with εὐχαριστῶ than
with the intervening words, and explains
the grounds of the Apostle’s
thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὴν ἀγάπην κ.τ.λ.] i.e. ‘the faith
which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus
Christ and the love which thou
showest to all the saints.’ The logical
order is violated, and the clauses are
inverted in the second part of the sentence,
thus producing an example of
the figure called chiasm; see Gal. iv.
4, 5. This results here from the Apostle’s
setting down the thoughts in
the sequence in which they occur to
him, without paying regard to symmetrical
arrangement. The first and
prominent thought is Philemon’s love.
This suggests the mention of his faith,
as the source from which it springs.
This again requires a reference to the
object of faith. And then at length
comes the deferred sequel to the first
thought—the range and comprehensiveness
of his love. The transition
from the object of faith to the object
of love is more easy, because the love
is represented as springing from the
faith. Some copies transpose the
order, reading τὴν πίστιν καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην—an
obvious emendation. Others
would obviate the difficulty by giving
to πίστιν the meaning ‘fidelity, stedfastness’:
Winer § 1. p. 511 sq. Thus
they are enabled to refer both words,
πίστιν καὶ ἀγάπην, equally to both
the clauses which follow. But, though
this is a legitimate sense of πίστις
in St Paul (see <cite>Galatians</cite>, p. 155),
yet in immediate connexion with ἣν
ἔχεις πρὸς τὸν Κύριον Ἰησοῦν, it is
hardly possible that the word can
have any other than its proper theological
meaning. See the opening of
the contemporary epistle, Col. i. 4.</p>

<p class='c033'>πρὸς κ.τ.λ.] The change of prepositions,
πρὸς τὸν Κύριον ‘<em>towards</em> the
Lord’ and εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους ‘<em>unto</em> the
saints’, deserves attention. It seems
to arise from the instinctive desire to
separate the two clauses, as they refer
to different words in the preceding
part of the sentence. Of the two prepositions
the former (προ-ς) signifies
<em>direction</em> ‘forward to’, ‘towards’; the
latter (ἐν-ς) <em>arrival</em> and so <em>contact</em>,
‘in-to’, ‘unto.’ Consequently either
might be used in either connexion;
and as a matter of fact εἰς is much
more common with πίστις (πιστεύειν), as
it is also with ἀγάπη, πρός being quite
exceptional (1 Thess. i. 8 ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν
ἡ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν; comp. 2 Cor. iii. 4).
But where a distinction is necessary,
there is a propriety in using πρός of
the faith which aspires <em>towards</em> Christ,
and εἰς of the love which is exerted
<em>upon</em> men. Some good copies read
εἰς here in both clauses.</p>

<p class='c034'>6. ὅπως κ.τ.λ.] to be taken with
μνείαν σου ποιούμενος κ.τ.λ., as giving
the aim and purport of St Paul’s
prayer. Others connect it with hὲν
ἔχεις, as if it described the tendency
of Philemon’s faith, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ita ut’</span>; but, even
if ὅπως could bear this meaning, such
a connexion is altogether harsh and
improbable.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἡ κοινωνία κ.τ.λ.] Of many interpretations
which have been, or might be,
given of these words, two seem to deserve
consideration. (1) ‘Your friendly
offices and sympathies, your kindly
deeds of charity, which spring from
your faith’: comp. Phil. i. 5 ἐπὶ τῇ
κοινωνίᾳ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, Heb.
xiii. 16 τῆς εὐποι"ίας καὶ κοινωνίας,
whence κοινωνία is used especially
of ‘contributions, almsgiving’, Rom.
xv. 26, 2 Cor. viii. 4, ix. 13. (2)
‘Your communion with God through
faith’: comp. 1 Cor. i. 9, and see also
2 Cor. xiii. 13, 1 Joh. i. 3, 6, 7. The
parallel passages strongly support
the former sense. Other interpretations
proposed are, ‘The participation
of others in your faith, through
your example’, or ‘your communion
with me, springing out of your faith’.
This last, which is widely received, is
suggested by ver. 17; εἰ κοινωνὸς εἶ,
φησί, κατὰ τὴν πίστιν, writes Chrysostom,
καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἄλλα ὀφείλεις κοινωνεῖν
(comp. Tit. i. 3 κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν):
but it seems quite out of place in this
context.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐνεργής] ‘<em>effective</em>’. The Latin
translators must have read ἐναργής,
for they render the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>evidens</em></span> or
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>manifesta</em></span>. Jerome (<em>ad loc.</em>) speaks
of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>evidens</em></span> as the reading of the Latin,
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>efficax</em></span> of the Greek text. The

<p class='c034'>ἐν ἐπιγνώσει κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>in the perfect
knowledge of every good thing</em>’. This
ἐπίγνωσις, involving as it does the
complete appropriation of all truth
and the unreserved identification with
God’s will, is the goal and crown of
the believer’s course. The Apostle
does not say ‘in the possession’ or ‘in
the performance’ but ‘in the knowledge
of every good thing’; for, in this
higher sense of knowledge, to know is
both to possess and to perform. In
all the epistles of the Roman captivity
St Paul’s prayer for his correspondents
culminates in this word
ἐπίγνωσις: see the note on Col. i. 9.
This ἐπίγνωσις is the result and the
reward of faith manifesting itself in
deeds of love, ὅπως ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεως
κ.τ.λ. For the sequence comp.
Ephes. iv. 13 εἰς τὴν ἑνότητα τῆς πίστεως

i. 1 κατὰ πίστιν ἐκλεκτῶν Θεοῦ καὶ ἐπίγνωσιν
ἀληθείας τῆς κατ’ εὐσέβειαν.
The ἐπίγνωσις therefore which the
Apostle contemplates is Philemon’s
own. There is no reference to the
force of his example on others, as it
is sometimes interpreted, ‘in their recognition
of every good thing which
is wrought in you’.</p>

<p class='c033'>τοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν] ‘<em>which is in us Christians</em>’,
‘which is placed within our
reach by the Gospel’; i.e. the whole
range of spiritual blessings, the complete
cycle of Christian truth. If the
reading τοῦ ἐν ὑμῖν be adopted, the
reference will be restricted to the
brotherhood at Colossæ, but the
meaning must be substantially the
same. Though ὑμῖν has somewhat
better support, we seem to be justified
in preferring ἡμῖν as being much
more expressive. In such cases the
<span class='fss'>MSS</span> are of no great authority; and in
the present instance scribes would be
strongly tempted to alter ἡμῖν into
ὑμῖν from a misapprehension of the
sense, and a wish to apply the words
to Philemon and his household. A
similar misapprehension doubtless led
in some copies to the omission of τοῦ,
which seemed to be superfluous but
is really required for the sense.</p>

<p class='c034'>εἰς Χριστόν] ‘<em>unto Christ</em>’, i.e. leading
to Him as the goal. The words
should be connected not with τοῦ ἐν
ἡμῖν, but with the main statement of
the sentence ἐνεργὴς γένηται κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>7. χαρὰν γάρ] This sentence again
must not be connected with the words
immediately preceding. It gives the
motive of the Apostle’s thanksgiving
mentioned in ver. 4. This thanksgiving
was the outpouring of gratitude
for the joy and comfort that he had
received in his bonds, from the report
of Philemon’s generous charity. The
connexion therefore is εὐχαριστῶ τῷ
Θεῷ μου ...... ἀκούων σου τὴν ἀγάπην
... χαρὰν γὰρ πολλὴν ἔσχον κ.τ.λ. For
χαράν the received text (Steph. but not
Elz.) reads χάριν, which is taken to
mean ‘thankfulness’ (1 Tim. i. 12,
2 Tim. i. 3); but this reading is absolutely
condemned by the paucity of
ancient authority.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὰ σπλάγχνα] ‘<em>the heart, the spirits</em>’.
On τὰ σπλάγχνα, the nobler viscera,
regarded as the seat of the emotions,

the prominent idea is that of terror,
grief, despondency, etc.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀναπέπαυται] ‘<em>have been relieved,

<p class='c034'>8–17. ‘Encouraged by these tidings
of thy loving spirit, I prefer to entreat,
where I might command. My
office gives me authority to dictate
thy duty in plain language, but love
bids me plead as a suitor. Have I not
indeed a right to command—I Paul
whom Christ Jesus long ago commissioned
as His ambassador, and whom
now He has exalted to the rank of His
prisoner? But I entreat thee. I have
a favour to ask for a son of my own—one
doubly dear to me, because I became
his father amidst the sorrows of
my bonds. I speak of Onesimus, who
in times past was found wholly untrue
to his name, who was then far from
useful to thee, but now is useful to
thee—yea, and to myself also. Him I
send back to thee, and I entreat thee
to take him into thy favour, for in
giving him I am giving my own heart.
Indeed I would gladly have detained
him with me, that he might minister
to me on thy behalf, in these bonds
with which the Gospel has invested
me. But I had scruples. I did not
wish to do anything without thy direct
consent; for then it might have seemed
(though it were only seeming) as if
thy kindly offices had been rendered
by compulsion and not of free will.
So I have sent him back. Indeed it
may have been God’s providential design,
that he was parted from thee for
a season, only that thou mightest regain
him for ever; that he left thee as
a slave, only that he might return to
thee a beloved brother. This indeed
he is to me most of all; and, if to me,
must he not be so much more to thee,
both in worldly things and in spiritual?
If therefore thou regardest me as a
friend and companion, take him to
thee, as if he were myself’.</p>

<p class='c034'>8. Διό] i.e. ‘Seeing that I have
these proofs of thy love, I prefer to
entreat, where I might command’.</p>

<p class='c034'>παρρησίαν] ‘<em>confidence</em>’, literally
‘<em>freedom</em>’ or ‘<em>privilege of speech</em>’;
see the notes on Col. ii. 15, Ephes. iii.
12. It was his Apostolic authority
which gave him this right to command
in plain language. Hence the addition
ἐν Χριστῷ.</p>

<p class='c034'>το ἀνῆκον] ‘<em>what is fitting</em>’: see
the note on Col. iii. 18.</p>

<p class='c034'>9. διὰ τὴν ἀγάπην] ‘<em>for love’s sake</em>’,
i.e. ‘having respect to the claims of
love’. It is not Philemon’s love (vv.
5, 7,) nor St Paul’s own love, but love
absolutely, love regarded as a principle
which demands a deferential respect.</p>

<p class='c034'>τοιοῦτος ὢν κ.τ.λ.] ‘<em>being such an
one as Paul an ambassador, and now
also a prisoner, of Christ Jesus</em>’.
Several questions of more or less difficulty
arise on these words. (1) Is
τοιοῦτος ὤν to be connected with or
separated from ὡς Παῦλος κ.τ.λ.? If separated,
τοιοῦτος ὤν will mean ‘though
as an Apostle I am armed with such
authority’, and ὡς Παῦλος κ.τ.λ. will
describe his condescension to entreaty,
‘yet as simply Paul, etc.’ But the
other construction is much more probable
for the following reasons., (<em>a</em>)
τοιοῦτος ὤν so used, implying, as it
would, something of a <em>personal</em> boast,
seems unlike St Paul’s usual mode
of speaking. Several interpreters indeed,
taking τοιοῦτος ὤν separately,
refer it to ver. 8, ‘seeing that this is
my disposition’, i.e. ‘seeing that I
desire to entreat’; but τοιοῦτος suggests
more than an accidental impulse.
(<em>b</em>) As τοιοῦτος and ὡς are correlative
words, it is more natural to connect them
together; comp. Plato <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Symp.</cite></span> 181 <span class='fss'>E</span>
προσαναγκάζειν τὸ τοιοῦτον ὥσπερ καὶ
κ.τ.λ., Alexis (Meineke <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fragm. Com.</cite></span>
<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 399) τοιοῦτο τὸ ζῆν ἐστιν ὥσπερ
ὁι κύβοι. Such passages are an answer
to the objection that τοιοῦτος would
require some stronger word than ὡς,
such as οἷος, ὅς, or ὥστε. Even after
such expressions as ὁ ἀυτός, τὸ ἀυτό,
instances occur of ὥς (ὥσπερ): see
Lobeck <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phryn.</cite></span> p. 427, Stallbaum on
Plat. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phæd.</cite></span> 86 <span class='fss'>A.</span> Indeed it may be
questioned whether any word but ὡς
would give exactly St Paul’s meaning
here. (<em>c</em>) All the Greek commentators
without a single exception connect
the words τοιοῦτος ὢν ὥς Παῦλος together.
(2) Assuming that the words
τοιοῦτος ὢν ὡς κ.τ.λ. are taken together,
should they be connected with
the preceding or the following sentence?
On the whole the passage is
more forcible, if they are linked to the
preceding words. In this case the resumptive
παρακαλῶ (ver. 10) begins a
new sentence, which introduces a fresh
subject. The Apostle has before described
the character of his appeal;
he now speaks of its object. (3) In
either connexion, what is the point of
the words τοιοῦτος ὢν ὡς Παῦλος
κ.τ.λ.? Do they lay down the grounds
of his <em>entreaty</em>, or do they enforce his
right to <em>command</em>? If the view of
πρεσβύτης adopted below be correct,
the latter must be the true interpretation;
but even though πρεσβύτης
be taken in its ordinary sense, this
will still remain the more probable
alternative; for, while πρεσβύτης and
δέσμιος would suit either entreaty or
command, the addition Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ
suggests an appeal to authority.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὡς Παῦλος] The mention of his personal
name involves an assertion of
authority, as in Ephes. iii. 1; comp.
Gal. v. 2, with the note there. Theodoret
writes, ὁ Παῦλον ἀκούσας τῆς
οἰκουμένης ἀκούει τὸν κήρυκα, γῆς καὶ
θαλάττης τὸν γεωργόν, τῆς ἐκλογῆς τὸ
σκεῦος, κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c034'>πρεσβύτης] Comparing a passage in
the contemporary epistle, Ephes. vi.
20 ὑπὲρ ὁῦ πρεσβεύω ἐν ἁλύσει, it
had occurred to me that we should
read πρεσβευτής here, before I was
aware that this conjecture had been
anticipated by others, e.g. by Bentley
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Crit. Sacr.</cite></span> p. 93) and by Benson
(<cite>Paraphrase etc. on Six Epistles of
St Paul</cite> p. 357). It has since been
suggested independently in Linwood’s
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Observ. quæd. in nonnulla N. T. loca</cite></span>
1865, and probably others have entertained
the same thought. Still believing
that St Paul here speaks of himself
as an ‘ambassador’, I now question
whether any change is necessary.
There is reason for thinking that in
the common dialect πρεσβύτης may
have been written indifferently for
πρεσβευτής in St Paul’s time; and if
so, the form here may be due, not to
some comparatively late scribe, but
to the original autograph itself or to
an immediate transcript. In 1 Macc.
xiv. 21 the Sinaitic <span class='fss'>MS</span> has οι πρεσβυτεροι
(a corruption of οι πρεσβυται
οι, for the common reading is οἱ πρεσβευτὰι
οἱ); in xiv. 22 it reads πρεσβυται
Ιουδαιων; but in xiii. 21 πρεσβευτας:
though in all passages alike the
meaning is ‘ambassadors’. Again the
Alexandrian <span class='fss'>MS</span> has πρεσβυτας in xiii.
21, but πρεσβευται in xiv. 22, and οι
πρεσβευτε οι (i.e. οἱ πρεσβευτὰι οἱ) in
xiv. 21. In 2 Macc. xi. 34 this same
<span class='fss'>MS</span> has πρεσβυτε, and the reading of
the common texts of the <span class='fss'>LXX</span> (even
Tischendorf and Fritzsche) there is
πρεσβῦται. Grimm treats it as meaning
‘ambassadors’, without even noticing
the form. Other <span class='fss'>MSS</span> are also
mentioned in Holmes and Parsons
which have the form πρεσβυτης in
1 Macc. xiii. 21. In 2 Chron. xxxii.
31 again the word for ‘ambassador’
is written thus in the <cite>Vatican</cite> <span class='fss'>MS</span>,
though the ε is added above the line;
and here too several <span class='fss'>MSS</span> in Holmes
and Parsons agree in reading πρεσβύταις.
Thus it is plain that, in
the age of our earliest extant <span class='fss'>MSS</span>
at all events, the scribes used both
forms indifferently in this sense. So
also Eusebius on Isaiah xviii. 2 writes
ὁ δε Ἀκύλας &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>πρεσβύτας</em>&nbsp; ἐξέδωκεν
εἰπών, (Ο ἀποστέλλων ἐν θαλάσσῃ πρεσβύτας.
Again in Ignat. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Smyrn.</cite></span> 11
θεοπρεσβύτης is the form in all the
<span class='fss'>MSS</span> of either recension, though the
meaning is plainly ‘an ambassador
of God.’ So too in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem. Hom.</cite></span> Ep.
Clem. 6 the <span class='fss'>MSS</span> read ὁ τῆς ἀληθείας
πρεσβύτης, which even Schwegler and
Dressel tacitly retain. See also Appian
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Samn.</cite></span> 7, where πρεσβευτοῦ is due
to the later editors, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Acta Thomæ</cite></span>
§ 10, where there is a v. l. πρεσβύτης
in at least one <span class='fss'>MS</span>. And probably examples
of this substitution might be
largely multiplied.
The main reason for adopting this
reading is the parallel passage, which
suggests it very strongly. The difficulty
which many find in St Paul’s
describing himself as an old man is
not serious. On any showing he must
have been verging on sixty at this
time, and may have been some years
older. A life of unintermittent toil
and suffering, such as he had lived,
would bring a premature decay; and
looking back on a long eventful life,
he would naturally so think and speak
of himself. Thus Roger Bacon (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Opus
Majus</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I</span> 10, p. 15, ed. Jebb; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Opus Tertium</cite></span>
p. 63, ed. Brewer) writes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘me
senem’</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘nos senes’</span>, in 1267, though
he appears to have been not more
than fifty-two or fifty-three at the
time and lived at least a quarter of a
century after (see E. Charles <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Roger
Bacon, Sa Vie etc.</cite></span> pp. 4 sq., 40). So
too Scott in his fifty-fifth year speaks
of himself as ‘an old grey man’
and ‘aged’ (Lockhart’s <cite>Life</cite> <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> pp.
327, 357). It is more difficult to
understand how St Paul should make
his age a ground of appeal to Philemon
who, if Archippus was his
son, cannot have been much younger
than himself. The commentator Hilary
says that the Apostle appeals
to his friend <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quasi coævum ætatis’</span>,
but this idea is foreign to the
context. The comment of Theophylact
is, τοιοῦτος ὤν, φησι, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>πρεσβευτής</em>&nbsp;,
καὶ ὅυτως ἄξιος ἀκούεσθαι, ὡς
εἰκὸς Παῦλον πρεσβύτην, τουτέστι καὶ
ἀπὸ τοῦ διδασκαλικοῦ ἀξίωματος καὶ
&nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τοῦ χρόνου</em>&nbsp; τὸ αἰδέσιμον ἔχοντα κ.τ.λ.
Does he mean to include both meanings
in πρεσβύτης? Or is he accidentally
borrowing the term ‘ambassador’
from some earlier commentator without
seeing its bearing?</p>

<p class='c034'>καὶ δέσμιος] Another title to respect.
The mention of his bonds might suggest
either an appeal for commiseration
or a claim of authority: see the
note on ver. 13. Here the addition of
Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ invests it with the character
of an official title, and so gives
prominence to the latter idea. To his
old office of ‘ambassador’ Christ has
added the new title of ‘prisoner’. The
genitive Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ belongs to
πρεσβύτης as well as to δέσμιος, and
in both cases describes the person who
confers the office or rank.</p>

τὸ χριστὸν ἡδὺ καὶ εὔχρηστον κ.τ.λ.
and see <cite>Philippians</cite> p. 16 note. Any
such allusion however, even if it should
not involve an anachronism, is far too
recondite to be probable here. The

<p class='c034'>καὶ ἐμοί] An after-thought; comp.
Phil. ii. 27 ἠλέησεν αὐτόν, οὐκ αὐτὸν
δὲ μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐμέ. This accounts
for the exceptional order, where according
to common Greek usage the
first person would naturally precede
the second.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀνέπεμψα] ‘<em>I send back</em>’, the epistolary
aorist used for the present: see
the notes on Phil. ii. 25, 28. So too ἔγραψα,
ver. 19, 21 (see the note). It is
clear both from the context here, and
from Col. iv. 7–9, that Onesimus accompanied
the letter.</p>

<p class='c034'>12. αὐτὸν κ.τ.λ.] The reading of
the received text is &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>σὺ δὲ</em>&nbsp; αὐτόν, τουτέστι
τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>προσλαβοῦ</em>&nbsp;.
The words thus supplied doubtless
give the right construction, but must
be rejected as deficient in authority.
The accusative is suspended; the sentence
changes its form and loses itself
in a number of dependent clauses;
and the main point is not resumed till
ver. 17 προσλαβοῦ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐμέ, the
grammar having been meanwhile dislocated.
For the emphatic position
of αὐτόν comp. John ix. 21, 23, Ephes.

<p class='c034'>τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα] ‘<em>my very heart</em>’,
a mode of speech common in all languages.
For the meaning of σπλάγχνα
see the note on Phil. i. 8. Comp.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Test. Patr.</cite></span> Zab. 8, Neph. 4, in both
which passages Christ is called τὸ
σπλάγχνον of God, and in the first it
is said ἔχετε εὐσπλαγχνίαν ... ἵνα καὶ ὁ
Κύριος εἰς ὑμᾶς σπλαγχνισθὲις ἐλέησῃ
ὑμᾶς· ὅτι καίγε ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων ἡμερῶν
ὁ Θεὸς ἀποστέλλει τὸ σπλάγχνον αὐτοῦ
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κ.τ.λ. Otherwise
τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα has been interpreted
‘<em>my son</em>’ (comp. ver. 10 ὃν ἐγέννησα
κ.τ.λ.), and it is so rendered here in
the Peshito. For this sense of σπλάγχνα
comp. Artemid. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Oneir.</cite></span> i. 44 οἱ
παῖδες σπλάγχνα λέγονται, <em>ib.</em> v. 57
τὰ δὲ σπλάγχνα [ἐσήμαινε] τὸν παῖδα,
οὕτω γὰρ καὶ τὸν παῖδα καλεῖν ἔθος ἐστι.
With this meaning it is used not less
of the father than of the mother;
e.g. Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Joseph.</cite></span> 5 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 45) θηρσὶν

<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 501 ὁ μὲν προτείνεται τὰ σπλάγχνα
τιμὴν τῶν τροφῶν. The Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>viscera</em></span>
occurs still more frequently in
this sense, as the passages quoted in
Wetstein and Suicer show. For this
latter interpretation there is much to
be said. But it adds nothing to the
previous ὃν ἐγέννησα κ.τ.λ., and (what
is a more serious objection) it is
wholly unsupported by St Paul’s
usage elsewhere, which connects
σπλάγχνα with a different class of
ideas: see e.g. vv. 7, 20.</p>

follows, in two respects; (1) While
βούλεσθαι involves the idea of ‘purpose,
deliberation, desire, mind’, θέλειν
denotes simply ‘will’; Epictet. i.

The change of tenses is significant.
The imperfect implies a tentative, inchoate
process; while the aorist describes
a definite and complete act.
The will stepped in and put an end
to the inclinations of the mind. Indeed
the imperfect of this and similar
verbs are not infrequently used where
the wish is stopped at the outset by
some antecedent consideration which
renders it impossible, and thus practically
it is not entertained at all: e.g.

Acts xxv. 22 ἐβουλόμην καὶ αὐτὸς

been too much to ask’. Similarly
ἤθελον Gal. iv. 20, ηὐχόμην Rom. ix. 3.
See <cite>Revision of the English New
Testament</cite> p. 96. So here a not improbable
meaning would be not ‘I
was desirous’, but ‘I could have desired’.</p>

opposed to the following ἀπέχῃς, ver.

ὑμέτερον ὑστέρημα αὐτοὶ ἀνεπλήρωσαν.
See the note on Col. i. 7. With a delicate
tact the Apostle assumes that
Philemon would have wished to perform
these friendly offices in person, if
it had been possible.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς] An indirect appeal
to his compassion: see vv. 1, 9, 10.
In this instance however (as in ver. 9)
the appeal assumes a tone of authority,
by reference to the occasion of his
bonds. For the genitive τοῦ εὐαγγελίου,
describing the origin, comp. Col.
i. 23 τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου. They
were not shackles which self had
riveted, but a chain with which
Christ had invested him. Thus they
were as a badge of office or a decoration
of honour. In this respect, as in
others, the language of St Paul is
echoed in the epistles of St Ignatius.
Here too entreaty and triumph alternate;
the saint’s bonds are at once a
ground for appeal and a theme of
thanksgiving: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Trall.</cite></span> 12 παρακαλεῖ

<a href='#Page_409'>&nbsp;→</a></p>

<p class='c033'>ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην] St Paul does not
say κατὰ ἀνάγκην but ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην.
He will not suppose that it would
really be by constraint; but it must
not even wear <em>the appearance</em> (ὡς) of
being so: comp. 2 Cor. xi. 17 ὡς ἐν
ἀφροσύνῃ. See Plin. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ep.</cite></span> ix. 21 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Vereor
ne videar non rogare sed cogere’</span>;
where, as here, the writer is asking
his correspondent to forgive a domestic
who has offended.</p>

<p class='c034'>τὸ ἀγαθόν σου] ‘<em>the benefit</em> arising
<em>from thee</em>’, i.e. ‘the good which I
should get from the continued presence
of Onesimus, and which would
be owing to thee’.</p>

<p class='c034'>κατὰ ἑκούσιον] as in Num. xv. 3. The
form καθ’ ἑκουσίαν is perhaps more
classical: Thuc. viii. 27 καθ’ ἑκουσίαν
ἢ πάνυ γε ἀνάγκῃ. The word understood
in the one case appears to be
τρόπον (Porphyr. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Abst.</cite></span> i. 9 καθ’
ἑκούσιον τρόπον, comp. Eur. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Med.</cite></span> 751
ἑκουσίῳ τρόπῳ); in the other, γνώμην
(so ἑκουσίᾳ, ἐξ ἑκουσίας, etc.): comp.
Lobeck <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Phryn.</cite></span> p. 4.</p>

<p class='c034'>15. τάχα γὰρ κ.τ.λ.] The γὰρ explains
an additional motive which
guided the Apostle’s decision: ‘I did
not dare to detain him, however
much I desired it. I might have defeated
the purpose for which God in
His good providence allowed him to
leave thee’.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐχωρίσθη] ‘He does not say’, writes
Chrysostom, ‘<em>For this cause he fled</em>,
but <em>For this cause he was parted</em>:
for he would appease Philemon by a
more euphemistic phrase. And again
he does not say <em>he parted himself</em>,
but <em>he was parted</em>: since the design
was not Onesimus’ own to depart for
this or that reason: just as Joseph
also, when excusing his brethren,
says (Gen. xlv. 5) <em>God did send me
hither</em>.’</p>

<p class='c034'>πρὸς ὥραν] ‘<em>for an hour</em>’, ‘<em>for a
short season</em>’: 2 Cor. vii. 8, Gal. ii. 5.
‘It was only a brief moment after all’,
the Apostle would say, ‘compared
with the magnitude of the work
wrought in it. He departed a reprobate;
he returns a saved man. He
departed for a few months; he returns
to be with you for all time and for
eternity’. The sense of αἴωνιον must
not be arbitrarily limited. Since he
left, Onesimus had obtained eternal
life, and eternal life involves eternal
interchange of friendship. His services
to his old master were no longer
barred by the gates of death.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀπέχῃς] In this connexion ἀπέχειν
may bear either of two senses: (1) ‘<em>to
have back, to have in return</em>’: or (2)
‘<em>to have to the full, to have wholly</em>’,
as in Phil. iv. 18 ἀπέχω πάντα (see the
note). In other words the prominent
idea in the word may be either <em>restitution</em>,
or <em>completeness</em>. The former
is the more probable sense here, as
suggested by κατέχειν in verse 13 and
by ἐχωρίσθη in this verse.</p>

<p class='c034'>16. ὡς δοῦλον] St Paul does not
say δοῦλον but ὡς δοῦλον. It was a
matter of indifference whether he
were outwardly δοῦλος or outwardly
ἐλεύθερος, since both are one in Christ
(Col. iii. 11). But though he might
still remain a slave, he could no longer
be <em>as</em> a slave. A change had been
wrought in him, independently of his
possible manumission: in Christ he
had become a brother. It should be
noticed also that the negative is not
μηκέτι, but οὐκέτι. The negation is
thus wholly independent of ἵνα ... ἀπέχῃς.
It describes not the possible
view of Philemon, but the actual state
of Onesimus. The ‘no more as a slave’
is an absolute fact, whether Philemon
chooses to recognise it or not.</p>

said ‘most of all to me’, he goes a
step further, ‘more than most of all

<p class='c034'>καὶ ἐν σαρκὶ κ.τ.λ.] ‘In both spheres
alike, in the affairs of this world and
in the affairs of the higher life.’ In
the former, as Meyer pointedly says,
Philemon had the brother for a slave;
in the latter he had the slave for a
brother: comp. Ign. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Trall.</cite></span> 12 κατὰ

Those are κοινωνοί, who have common
interests, common feelings, common
work.</p>

<p class='c034'>18–22. ‘But if he has done thee
any injury, or if he stands in thy debt,
set it down to my account. Here is my
signature—<em>Paul</em>—in my own handwriting.
Accept this as my bond. I
will repay thee. For I will not insist,
as I might, that thou art indebted
to me for much more than this; that
thou owest to me thine own self. Yes,
dear brother, let me receive from my
son in the faith such a return as a
father has a right to expect. Cheer
and refresh my spirits in Christ. I
have full confidence in thy compliance,
as I write this; for I know that
thou wilt do even more than I ask.
At the same time also prepare to
receive me on a visit; for I hope that
through your prayers I shall be set
free and given to you once more’.</p>

<p class='c034'>18. εἰ δέ τι] The case is stated
hypothetically but the words doubtless
describe the actual offence of
Onesimus. He had done his master
some injury, probably had robbed
him; and he had fled to escape punishment.
See the introduction.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἢ ὀφείλει] defining the offence which
has been indicated in ἠδίκησεν. But
still the Apostle refrains from using
the plain word ἔκλεψεν. He would
spare the penitent slave, and avoid
irritating the injured master.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἐλλόγα] ‘<em>reckon it in</em>’, ‘<em>set it down</em>’.
This form must be adopted instead of
ἐλλόγει which stands in the received
text, as the great preponderance of
authority shows. On the other hand
we have ἐλλογεῖται Rom. v. 13 (though
with a v. l. ἐλλογᾶται), ἐλλογουμένων
Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>C. I.</cite></span> no. 1732 <span class='fss'>A</span>, and ἐνλογεῖσθαι

<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 836. But the word is so rare
in any form, that these occurrences of
ἐλλογεῖν afford no ground for excluding
ἐλλογᾶν as impossible. The two
forms might be employed side by side,
just as we find ἐλεᾶν and ἐλεεῖν, ξυρᾶν
and ξυρεῖν, ἐρωτᾶν and ἐρωτεῖν (Matt.
xv. 23), and the like; see Buttmann
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ausf. Gramm.</cite></span> § 112 (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 53). The
word λογᾶν, as used by Lucian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Lexiph.</cite></span>
15 (where it is a desiderative ‘to be
eager to speak’, like φονᾶν, θανατᾶν,
φαρμακᾶν, etc.), has nothing to do with
the use of ἐλλογᾶν here.</p>

<p class='c034'>19. ἐγὼ Παῦλος] The introduction
of his own name gives it the character
of a formal and binding signature:
comp. 1 Cor. xvi. 21, Col. iv. 18,
2 Thess. iii. 17. A signature to a
deed in ancient or mediæval times
would commonly take this form ἐγὼ ὁ
δεῖνα,—‘<em>I</em> so and so’; where we should
omit the marks of the first person.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἔγραψα] An epistolary or documentary
aorist, as in ver. 21; so too
ἀνέπεμψα ver. 11. See the note on
ἔγραψα Gal. vi. 11. The aorist is the
tense commonly used in signatures;
e.g. ὑπέγραψα to the conciliar decrees.</p>

<p class='c034'>This incidental mention of his autograph,
occurring where it does,
shows that he wrote the whole letter
with his own hand. This procedure
is quite exceptional, just as the purport
of the letter is exceptional. In

employed an amanuensis, only adding
a few words in his own handwriting

<p class='c033'>ἐν Κυρίῳ] As he had begotten Philemon
ἐν Κυρίῳ (comp. 1 Cor. iv. 15, 17),
so it was ἐν Κυρίῳ that he looked for
the recompense of filial offices.</p>

<p class='c034'>ἀνάπαυσον κ.τ.λ.] See the note ver. <a href='#ph_7'>7</a>.</p>

<p class='c034'>21. ἔγραψα] ‘<em>I write</em>’: see the note
on ver. <a href='#ph_19'>19</a>.</p>

<p class='c034'>ὑπὲρ ἃ λέγω κ.τ.λ.] What was the
thought upmost in the Apostle’s mind
when he penned these words? Did
he contemplate the manumission of
Onesimus? If so, the restraint which
he imposes upon himself is significant.
Indeed throughout this epistle
the idea would seem to be present to
his thoughts, though the word never
passes his lips. This reserve is eminently
characteristic of the Gospel.
Slavery is never directly attacked as
such, but principles are inculcated
which must prove fatal to it.</p>

<p class='c034'>22. ἅμα δὲ κ.τ.λ.] When St Paul
first contemplated visiting Rome, he
had intended, after leaving the metropolis,
to pass westward into Spain;
Rom. xv. 24, 28. But by this time he
appears to have altered his plans, purposing
first to revisit Greece and Asia
Minor. Thus in Phil. ii. 24 he looks
forward to seeing the Philippians
shortly; while here he contemplates a
visit to the Churches of the Lycus
valley.</p>

<p class='c034'>There is a gentle compulsion in this
mention of a personal visit to Colossæ.
The Apostle would thus be able to
see for himself that Philemon had not
disappointed his expectations. Similarly
Serapion in Eus. <cite>H.E.</cite> vi. 12

<p class='c034'>ξενίαν] ‘<em>a lodging</em>’; comp. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Clem.
Hom.</cite></span> xii. 2 πρόαξωσιν τὰς ξενίας ἑτοιμάζοντες.
So the Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>parare hospitium</em></span>
Cic. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>ad Att.</cite></span> xiv. 2, Mart. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ep.</cite></span>
ix. 1. This latter passage, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Vale et
para hospitium’</span>, closely resembles St
Paul’s language here. In the expression
before us ξενία is probably the
<em>place</em> of entertainment: but in such
phrases as καλεῖν ἐπὶ ξενίᾳ, παρακαλεῖν
επὶ ξενίαν, φροντίζειν ξενίας, and the
like, it denotes the offices of hospitality.
The Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>hospitium</em></span> also includes
both senses. The ξενία, as a
lodging, may denote either quarters
in an inn or a room in a private house:
see <cite>Philippians</cite> p. 9. For the latter
comp. Plato <cite>Tim.</cite> 20 <span class='fss'>C</span> παρὰ Κριτίαν
πρὸς τὸν ξενῶνα, οὗ καὶ καταλύομεν,
ἀφικόμεθα. In this case the response
would doubtless be a hospitable reception
in Philemon’s home; but the
request does not assume so much as
this.</p>

<p class='c034'>χαρισθήσομαι] ‘<em>I shall be granted
to you</em>’. The grant (χαρίζεσθαι) of
one person to another, may be for
purposes either (1) of destruction, as
Acts xxv. 11 οὐδεὶς με δύναται αὐτοῖς
χαρίσασθαι (comp. ver. 16), or (2) of
preservation, as Acts iii. 14 ᾐτήσασθε
ἄνδρα φονέα χαρισθῆναι ὑμῖν, and
here.</p>

<p class='c034'>23–25. ‘Epaphras my fellow-captive
in Christ Jesus salutes you. As
do also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas,
and Luke, my fellow-labourers. The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
thee and thy household, and sanctify
the spirit of you all.’</p>

<p class='c034'>23 sq. For these salutations see
the notes on Col. iv. 10 sq. Epaphras
is mentioned first because he was a
Colossian (Col. iv. 12) and, as the evangelist
of Colossæ (see p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a> sq.), doubtless
well known to Philemon. Of the
four others Aristarchus and Mark belonged
to the Circumcision (Col. iv. 11),
while Demas and Luke were Gentile
Christians. All these were of Greek
or Asiatic origin and would probably
be well known to Philemon, at least
by name. On the other hand Jesus
Justus, who is honourably mentioned
in the Colossian letter (iv. 11), but
passed over here, may have been a
Roman Christian.</p>

<p class='c047'>p. 38, note <a href='#f125'>125</a>. The investigations of M. Waddington respecting the chronology
of this period (see below) require a modification of the dates here given
for the earthquakes in the second century. He enumerates three:
(1) One at Rhodes, from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 138–142; (2) One which destroyed
Mitylene and did considerable damage to Smyrna, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 151–152; (3) One
which destroyed Smyrna <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 180. These two last have been confounded
together by previous writers. See M. Waddington’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mémoire</cite></span>, pp. 242 sq.,
267 sq.</p>

<p class='c047'>p. 48, note <a href='#f160'>160</a>. On the names Ammias, Tatias, which are feminine and not
masculine, see below p. <a href='#Page_373'>373</a>.</p>

<p class='c047'>p. 49, <a href='#f161'>note</a>. I have here given the commonly received date for the martyrdom
of Polycarp; for I had not then seen M. Waddington’s investigations.
This writer seems to have proved conclusively that it took place several
years earlier, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 155: see his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mémoire sur la Chronologie du Rhéteur
Ælius Aristide</cite></span> p. 232 sq., in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires de l’Académie des Inscriptions</cite></span>,

<p class='c047'>pp. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>, <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>. As these remarks respecting the silence of Eusebius will seem to
be directed against the opinions expressed in a recent work, it may be
worth while stating that the early sheets of this commentary were struck
off nearly twelve months before <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> was published.
The expression in p. 53, note <a href='#f170'>170</a>, ‘numerous and patent quotations,’ is
too strongly worded, though the references to St James in Clement’s
Epistle seem to me to be clear. I might however have chosen other
more palpable illustrations from that epistle.</p>

<p class='c047'>p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>, l. 12. The Proconsulate of Paullus, under whom this martyrdom took
place, is dated by Borghesi (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>&OElig;uvres</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> p. 507) somewhere between
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 163–168, by Waddington (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Fastes des Provinces Asiatiques</cite></span> p. 731, in
Le Bas and Waddington <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Voyage Archéologique etc.</cite></span>) probably <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 164–166.
This rests on the assumption that the <em>Servillius Paullus</em> here
named must be identified with <em>L. Sergius Paullus</em> of the inscriptions.
The name <em>Sergius</em> is elsewhere confounded with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Servius</em></span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Servillius</em></span>)
owing to the use of contractions (see Borghesi <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 493, <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> p. 504).
The mistake must have been introduced very early into the text of
Eusebius. All the Greek <span class='fss'>MSS</span> have <em>Servillius</em> (<em>Servilius</em>), and so it is
written in the Syriac Version. Ruffinus however writes it correctly
<em>Sergius</em>.</p>

<p class='c047'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>p. <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>, line 1. We may conjecture that it was the earthquake under Gallienus
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 262) which proved fatal to Colossæ (see above p. 38, note <a href='#f125'>125</a>). This
is consistent with the fact that no Colossian coins later than Gordian
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 238–244) are extant. When St Chrysostom wrote, the city existed no
longer, as may be inferred from his comment (<span class='fss'>XI.</span> p. 323) ‘Ἡ πόλις τῆς
Φρυγίας ἦν· καὶ δῆλον ἐκ τοῦ τὴν Λαοδίκειαν πλησίον εἶναι.’</p>

<p class='c048'>On the other hand M. Renan (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Antechrist</cite></span> p. 99) says of the earthquake
under <em>Nero</em>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Colosses ne sut se relever; elle disparut presque du
nombre des églises;’</span> and he adds in a note <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Colosses n’a pas de

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following are among the most
important books of travel relating to
this district; Pococke <cite>Description of
the East and Some Other Countries</cite>, Vol.

Lycia</cite>, London 1840; de Tchihatcheff
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Asie Mineure, Description Physique,
Statistique et Archéologique</cite></span>, Paris
1853 etc., with the accompanying Atlas
(1860); de Laborde <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Voyage de l’Asie
Mineure</cite></span> (the expedition itself took
place in 1826, but the date on the
title-page is 1838, and the introduction
was written in 1861); Le Bas <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Voyage
Archéologique en Grèce et en Asie
Mineure</cite></span>, continued by Waddington
and not yet completed; Texier <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Description
de l’Asie Mineure</cite></span>, Vol. <span class='fss'>I</span>
(1839). It is hardly necessary to add
the smaller works of Texier and Le Bas
on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Asie Mineure</cite></span> (Paris 1862, 1863)
in Didot’s series <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Univers</cite></span>, as these
have only a secondary value. Of the
books enumerated, Hamilton’s work
is the most important for the topography,
etc.; Tchihatcheff’s for the
physical features; and Le Bas and
Waddington’s for the inscriptions,
etc. The best maps are those of
Hamilton and Tchihatcheff; to which
should be added the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Karte von Klein-Asien</cite></span>
by v. Vincke and others, published
by Schropp, Berlin 1844.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides books on Asia Minor generally,
some works relating especially to
the Seven Churches may be mentioned.
Smith’s <cite>Survey of the Seven Churches of
Asia</cite> (1678) is a work of great merit for
the time, and contains the earliest description
of the sites of these Phrygian
cities. It was published in Latin first,
and translated by its author afterwards.
Arundell’s <cite>Seven Churches</cite>
(1828) is a well-known book. Allom and
Walsh’s <cite>Constantinople and the Scenery
of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor
illustrated</cite> (1850) gives some views of
this district. Svoboda’s <cite>Seven Churches
of Asia</cite> (1869) contains 20 photographs
and an introduction by the Rev. H. B.
Tristram. This is a selection from
a larger series of Svoboda’s photographs,
published separately.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The maps differ very considerably
in this respect, nor do the statements
of travellers always agree. The direction
of the river, as given in the
text, accords with the maps of Hamilton
and Tchihatcheff, and with the
accounts of the most accurate writers.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Anton. Itin.</cite></span> p. 337 (Wesseling)
gives the distance as 6 miles. See also
Fellows <cite>Asia Minor</cite> p. 283, Hamilton
<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 514. The relative position of the
two cities appears in Laborde’s view,
pl. xxxix.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I do not find any distinct notice
of the distance; but, to judge from the
maps and itineraries of modern travellers,
this estimate will probably be
found not very far wrong.</p>

Vitruv. viii. 3 § 14 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Aliis coracino colore,’</span>
Laodicea being mentioned in the
context. Vitruvius represents this as
the natural colour of the fleeces, and
attributes it to the water drunk by the
sheep. See also Plin. <cite>N. H.</cite> viii. 48

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The position of Laodicea with
respect to the neighbouring streams is
accurately described by Pliny <cite>N.H.</cite>
v. 29 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Imposita est Lyco flumini, latera
affluentibus Asopo et Capro’</span>; see
Tchihatcheff P. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 258. Strabo
xii. (l.c.) is more careless in his description
(for it can hardly be, as
Tchihatcheff assumes, that he has
mistaken one of these two tributaries
for the Lycus itself), ἐνταῦθα δὲ καὶ
ὁ Κάπρος καὶ ὁ Λύκος συμβάλλε τῷ
Μαιάνδρῳ ποταμῷ ποταμὸς εὐμεγέθης,
where ἐνταῦθα refers to ὁ περὶ τὴν
Λαοδίκειαν τόπος, and where by the
junction of the stream with the Mæander
must be intended the junction
of the <em>combined</em> stream of the Lycus
and Caprus. On the coins of Laodicea
(Eckhel <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 166, Mionnet <span class='fss'>IV.</span>
p. 330, ib. Suppl. <span class='fss'>VII.</span> p. 587, 589)
the Lycus and Caprus appear together,
being sometimes represented
as a wolf and a wild-boar. The Asopus
is omitted, either as being a less important
stream or as being less capable
of symbolical representation. Of
modern travellers, Smith (p. 250), and
after him Pococke (p. 72), have correctly
described the position of the
streams. Chandler (p. 227), misled by
Strabo, mistakes the Caprus for the
Lycus and the Lycus for the Mæander.
The modern name of the Lycus is
Tchoruk Sú.</p>

the quarry out of which the modern
town of Denizli is built. Yet notwithstanding
these depredations they are
still very extensive, comprising an
amphitheatre, two or three theatres,
an aqueduct, etc. The amphitheatre
was built by the munificence of a
citizen of Laodicea only a few years
after St Paul wrote, as the inscription
testifies; Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Corp. Inscr.</cite></span> no.
3935. See especially Hamilton <span class='fss'>I.</span> p.

stern and massive solidity of the
Greeks.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these passages, testimony is

§ 17 (p. 631), ἐν ταῖς μεγίσταις ἐξετάζεται

It will be remembered also that Horace
singles out the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Cibyratica negotia</em></span>
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epist.</cite></span> i. 6. 33) to represent Oriental
trade generally. The importance of
Laodicea may be inferred from the fact
that, though the union was named after
Cibyra, its head-quarters were from the
first fixed at or soon afterwards transferred
to Laodicea.</p>

offers the alternative that <span class='large'>ασειϲ</span>,

An objection to this view, stronger
than those urged by Mr Waddington,
is the fact that Ἀσίς seems only to be
used as a feminine adjective. M.
Renan points to the fact that this
<span class='large'>ζευς ασεις</span> is represented with his
hand on the horns of a goat, and on
the strength of this coincidence would
identify him with ‘the Azazel of the
Semites’ (<cite>Saint Paul</cite>, p. 359), though

<p class='c000'>The modern name is given differently

mean that Hierapolis was situated
immediately in or by the Mesogis (for
the name does not seem ever to be applied
to the mountains between the
Lycus and Mæander), but that with
respect to Laodicea it stood over against
the Mesogis, as I have explained
it in the text. The view in Laborde
(pl. xxxix) shows the appearance of
Hierapolis  from  Laodicea. Strabo
had himself visited the place and
must have known how it was situated.
Some modern travellers however (e.g.
Chandler and Arundell) speak of the
plateau of Hierapolis as part of the
Mesogis. Steiger (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Kolosser</cite></span> p. 33)
gets over the difficulty by translating
Strabo’s words, ‘near the Mesogis but
on the opposite side (i.e. of the Mæander)

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the explanation of Hamilton
(<span class='fss'>I</span>. p. 509 sq.), who (with the doubtful
exception of Laborde) has the merit
of having first identified and described
the site of Colossæ. It stands on the
Tchoruk Sú (Lycus) at the point where
it is joined by two other streams, the
Bounar Bashi Sú and the Ak-Sú. In
confirmation of his opinion, Hamilton
found a tradition in the neighbourhood
that the river had once been covered
over at this spot (p. 522). He followed
the course of the Lycus for some distance
without finding any subterranean
channel (p. 521 sq.).</p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult to say whether the following
account in Strabo xii. 8 § 16
(p. 578) refers to the Lycus or not;
ὄρος Κάδμος ἐξ οὓ καὶ ὁ Λύκος ῥεῖ καὶ
ἄλλος ὁμώνυμος τῷ ὄρει· τὸ πλέον δ’
οὗτος ὑπὸ γῆς ῥυὲις εἶτ’ ἀνακύψας συνέπεσεν
εἰς ταὐτὸ τοῖς ἄλλοις ποταμοῖς, ἐμφαίνων
ἅμα καὶ τὸ πολύτρητον τῆς χώρας
καὶ τὸ εὔσειστον. If the Lycus is meant,
may not συνέπεσεν imply that this remarkable
feature had changed before
Strabo wrote?</p>

<p class='c000'>Laborde (p. 103), who visited the
place before Hamilton, though his account
was apparently not published
till later, fixes on the same site for
Colossæ, but thinks that he has discovered
the subterranean course of the
Lycus, to which Herodotus refers, much
higher up a stream, close to its source
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘à dix pas de cette source’</span>), which he
describes as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘à deux lieues au nord de
Colossæ.’</span> Yet in the same paragraph
he says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Or il [Hérodote, exact cicerone]
savait que <em>le Lycus disparaît
près de Colossæ, ville considérable de
la Phrygie</em>’</span> (the italics are his own).
He apparently does not see the
vast difference between his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>près de
Colossæ</em></span> thus widely interpreted and
the precise ἐν τῇ of Herodotus himself.
Obviously no great reliance can be
placed on the accuracy of a writer,
who treats his authorities thus. The
subterranean stream which Laborde
saw, and of which he gives a view
(pl. xl), may possibly be the phenomenon
to which Herodotus alludes; but
if so, Herodotus has expressed himself
very carelessly. On the whole Hamilton’s
solution seems much more
probable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arundell’s account (<cite>Seven Churches</cite>
p. 98 sq., <cite>Asia Minor</cite> p. 160 sq.) is
very confused, and it is not clear
whether he has fixed on the right site
for Colossæ; but it bears testimony to
the existence of two subterranean
courses of rivers, though neither of
them is close enough to the city to
satisfy Herodotus’ description.</p>

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">’præter jam dicta,’</span> and represent Pliny
as calling Colossæ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘oppidum celeberrimum.’</span>
Not unnaturally they find it
difficult to reconcile this expression
with Strabo’s statement. But in fact
Pliny has already exhausted all the
considerable towns, Hierapolis, Laodicea,
Apamea, etc., and even much
less important places than these (see
v. 28, 29 § 29), so that only decayed
and third-rate towns remain. The
Ancyra here mentioned is not the

as late as the reign of Gordian (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 238–244)
when they ceased to be struck,
universally have <span class="uncial">κολοϲϲηνοι</span> (or <span class="uncial">κολοϲηνοι</span>);
Mionnet <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 267 sq.:
see Babington <cite>Numismatic Chronicle</cite>
New series <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 1 sq., 6. In Hierocles
(<cite>Synecd.</cite> p. 666, Wessel.) and
in the <cite>Apostolic Constitutions</cite> (vii. 46)
Κολασσαί seems to be the original reading
of the text, and in later Byzantine
writers this form is common. If
Prof. Babington (p. 3) were right in
supposing that it is connected with
κολοσσός, the question of the correct
spelling might be regarded as settled;
but in a Phrygian city over which so
many Eastern nations swept in succession,
who shall say to what language
the name belonged, or what are
its affinities?</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, judging from classical usage,
we should say that Κολοσσαί was the
old form and that Κολασσαί did not
supplant it till some time after St
Paul’s age. This view is confirmed
by a review of the authorities for the
different readings in the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the opening of the epistle (i. 1)
the authorities for ἐν Κολοσσαῖς are
overwhelming. It is read by אBDFGL
(A is obliterated here and C is wanting);
and in the Old Latin, Vulgate,
and Armenian Versions. On the other
hand ἐν Κολασσαῖς is read by KP. 17. 37.
47, and among the versions by the Memphitic
and the Philoxenian Syriac
(<span class='htmlonly'><span class='large'><span lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">ܩܘܠܐܣܘܤ</span></span></span><span class='epubonly'><img class='ii' src='images/kolasos.jpg' alt='kolasos' /></span>,
though the marg.
gives <span class="uncial">κολϲϲαιϲ</span>). In the Peshito also
the present reading represents Κολασσαῖς,
but as the vowel was not expressed
originally and depends on the later
pointing, its authority can hardly be
quoted. The Thebaic is wanting here.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <em>heading</em> of the epistle however
there is considerably more authority
for the form in α. Κολασσαεις
is the reading of AB<sup>*</sup> KP. 37 (Κολασαεις).
47. C is wanting here, but has
Κολασσαεις in the subscription. On
the other hand Κολοσσαεις (or Κολοσσαις)
appears in אB<sup>1</sup> (according to
Tregelles, but B<sup>3</sup> Tisch.; see his introd.
p. xxxxviii) DFG (but G has left Κολασσαεις
in the heading of one page,
and Κολαοσαεις in another) L. 17 (Κολοσαεις),
in the Latin Version, and in
the margin of the Philoxenian Syriac.
The readings of both Peshito and
Philoxenian (text) here depend on the
vocalisation; and those of other versions
are not recorded. In the <em>subscription</em>
the preponderance of authority
is even more favourable to
Κολασσαεις.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking into account the obvious
tendency which there would be in
scribes to make the title πρὸς Κολοσσαεῖς
or πρὸς Κολασσαεῖς conform to
the opening ἐν Κολοσσαῖς or ἐν Κολασσαῖς,
as shown in G, we seem to
arrive at the conclusion that, while ἐν
Κολοσσαῖς was indisputably the original
reading in the opening, πρὸς Κολασσαεῖς
was probably the earlier reading
in the title. If so, the title must
have been added at a somewhat later
date; which is not improbable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Connected with this question is the
variation in the adjectival form, -ηνός
or -αεύς. Parallels to this double termination
occur in other words; e.g.
Δοκιμηνός, Δοκιμεύς; Λαοδικηνός, Λαοδικεύς;
Νικαηνός, Νικαεύς; Σαγαλασσηνός,
Σαγαλασσεύς, etc. The coins, while
they universally exhibit the form in ο,
are equally persistent in the termination
-ηνός, <span class="uncial">κολοϲϲηνων</span>; and it is
curious that to the form Κολοσσηνοί
in Strabo xii. 8 § 16 (p. 578) there is
a various reading Κολασσαεῖς. Thus,
though there is no necessary connexion
between the two, the termination
-ηνός seems to go with the ο form,
and the termination -αεύς with the α
form.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the above reasons I have written
confidently ἐν Κολοσσαῖς in the text,
and with more hesitation πρὸς Κολασσαεῖς
in the superscription.</p>

striking example of Judaic influence
at a later date. On coins struck at
this place in the reigns of Severus,
Macrinus, and the elder Philip, an
ark is represented floating on the
waters. Within are a man and a woman:
on the roof a bird is perched;
while in the air another bird approaches
bearing an olive-branch in
its claws. The ark bears the inscription
<span class='large'>νωε</span>. Outside are two standing
figures, a man and a woman (apparently
the same two who have been
represented within the ark), with their
hands raised as in the attitude of
prayer. The connexion of the ark
of Noah with Apamea is explained by
a passage in one of the Sibylline
Oracles (i. 261 sq.), where the mountain
overhanging Apamea is identified
with Ararat, and the ark (κιβωτός) is
stated to have rested there. Whether
this Apamea obtained its distinctive
surname of Cibotus, the Ark or Chest,
from its physical features, or from its
position as the centre of taxation and
finance for the district, or from some
other cause, it is difficult to say. In
any case this surname might naturally
suggest to those acquainted with the
Old Testament a connexion with the
deluge of Noah; but the idea would
not have been adopted in the coinage
of the place without the pressure of
strong Jewish influences. On these
coins see Eckhel <cite>Doctr. Num. Vet.</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r80'>80</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>M. Renan (<cite>Saint Paul</cite> pp. 51 sq.,
126, 313) maintains that the Galatia of
St Paul and St Luke is not the country
properly so called, but that they are
speaking of the Churches of Pisidian
Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe,
which lay within the <em>Roman province</em> of
Galatia. This interpretation of Galatia
necessarily affects his view of St
Paul’s routes (pp. 126 sq., 331 sq.); and
he supposes the Apostle on his third
missionary journey to have passed
through the valley of the Lycus, without
however remaining to preach the
Gospel there (pp. 331 sq., 356 sq., 362).
As Antioch in Pisidia would on this
hypothesis be the farthest church in
‘Galatia and Phrygia’ which St Paul
visited, his direct route from that city
to Ephesus (Acts xviii. 23, xix. 1)
would naturally lie by this valley. I
have already (<cite>Galatians</cite> pp. 18 sq., 22)
stated the serious objections to which
this interpretation of ‘Galatia’ is open,
and (if I mistake not) have answered
most of M. Renan’s arguments by anticipation.
But, as this interpretation
nearly affects an important point in
the history of St Paul’s dealings with
the Colossians, it is necessary to subject
it to a closer examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without stopping to enquire whether
this view is reconcilable with St
Paul’s assertion (Col. ii. 1) that these
churches in the Lycus valley ‘had not
seen his face in the flesh,’ it will appear
(I think) that M. Renan’s arguments
are in some cases untenable and
in others may be turned against himself.
The three heads under which
they may be conveniently considered
are: (i) The use of the name ‘Galatia’;
(ii) The itinerary of St Paul’s travels;
(iii) The historical notices in the Epistle
to the Galatians.</p>

<p class='c000'>(i) On the first point, M. Renan
states that St Paul was in the habit of
using the <em>official</em> name for each district
and therefore called the country
which extends from Antioch in Pisidia
to Derbe ‘Galatia,’ supporting this
view by the Apostle’s use of Asia,
Macedonia, and Achaia (p. 51). The
answer is that the names of these
elder provinces had very generally superseded
the local names, but this was
not the case with the other districts of
Asia Minor where the provinces had
been formed at a comparatively late
date. The usage of St Luke is a
good criterion. He also speaks of
Asia, Macedonia, and Achaia; but at
the same time his narrative abounds
in historical or ethnographical names
which have no official import; e.g.
Lycaonia, Mysia, Pamphylia, Pisidia,
Phrygia. Where we have no evidence,
it is reasonable to assume that St
Paul’s usage was conformable to St
Luke’s. And again, if we consider
St Luke’s account alone, how insuperable
are the difficulties which this
view of Galatia creates. The part of
Asia Minor, with which we are immediately
concerned, was comprised officially
in the provinces of Asia and
Galatia. On M. Renan’s showing, St
Luke, after calling Antioch a city of
Pisidia (xiii. 14) and Lystra and Derbe
cities of Lycaonia (xiv. 6), treats all
the three, together with the intermediate
Iconium, as belonging to Galatia
(xvi. 6, xviii. 23). He explains the inconsistency
by saying that in the former
case the narrative proceeds in detail,
in the latter in masses. But if so,
why should he combine a historical
and ethnological name Phrygia with
an official name Galatia in the same
breath, when the two are different in
kind and cannot be mutually exclusive?
‘Galatia and Asia,’ would be intelligible
on this supposition, but not ‘Galatia
and Phrygia.’ Moreover the very
form of the expression in xvi. 6, ‘the
Phrygian and Galatian country’ (according
to the correct reading which
M. Renan neglects) appears in its studied
vagueness to exclude the idea that
St Luke means the province of Galatia,
whose boundaries were precisely
marked. And even granting that the
Christian communities of Lycaonia
and Pisidia could by a straining of
language be called Churches of Galatia,
is it possible that St Paul would
address them personally as ‘ye foolish
Galatians’ (Gal. iii. 1)? Such language
would be no more appropriate
than if a modern preacher in a familiar
address were to appeal to the
Poles of Warsaw as ‘ye Russians,’ or
the Hungarians of Pesth as ‘ye Austrians,’
or the Irish of Cork as ‘ye
Englishmen.’</p>

<p class='c000'>(ii) In the itinerary of St Paul
several points require consideration.
(<em>a</em>) M. Renan lays stress on the fact
that in Acts xvi. 6, xviii. 23, the order
in which the names of Phrygia and
Galatia occur is inverted. I seem to
myself to have explained this satisfactorily
in the text. He appears to be
unaware of the correct reading in xvi.
6, τὴν Φρυγίαν καὶ Γαλατικὴν χώραν
(see <cite>Galatians</cite> p. 22), though it has an
important bearing on St Paul’s probable
route. (<em>b</em>) He states that Troas
was St Paul’s aim (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘l’objectif de Saint
Paul’</span>) in the one case (xvi. 6), and
Ephesus in the other (xviii. 23): consequently
he argues that Galatia, properly
so called, is inconceivable, as
there was no reason why he should
have made ‘this strange detour towards
the north.’ The answer is that
Troas was not his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘objectif’</span> in the
first instance, nor Ephesus in the second.
On the first occasion St Luke
states that the Apostle set out on his
journey with quite different intentions,
but that after he had got well to the
north of Asia Minor he was driven by a
series of divine intimations to proceed
first to Troas and thence to cross over
into Europe (see <em>Philippians</em> p. 48).
This narrative seems to me to imply
that he starts for his further travels
from some point in the western part
of Galatia proper. When he comes to
the borders of Mysia, he designs bearing
to the left and preaching in Asia;
but a divine voice forbids him. He
then purposes diverging to the right
and delivering his message in Bithynia;
but the same unseen power checks him
again. Thus he is driven forward, and
passes by Mysia to the coast at Troas
(Acts xvi. 6–8). Here all is plain.
But if we suppose him to start, not from
some town in Galatia proper such as
Pessinus, but from Antioch in Pisidia,
why should Bithynia, which would be
far out of the way, be mentioned at
all? On the second occasion, St Paul’s
primary object is to revisit the Galatian
Churches which he had planted
on the former journey (xviii. 23), and
it is not till after he has fulfilled this
intention that he goes to Ephesus.
(<em>c</em>) M. Renan also calls attention to
the difficulty of traversing ‘the central
steppe’ of Asia Minor. ‘There was
probably,’ he says, ‘at this epoch no
route from Iconium to Ancyra,’ and in
justification of this statement he refers
to Perrot, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Gal. Rom. prov.</cite></span> p.
102, 103. Even so, there were regular
roads from either Iconium or Antioch
to Pessinus; and this route would serve
equally well. Moreover the Apostle, who
was accustomed to ‘perils of rivers,
perils of robbers, perils in the wilderness’
(2 Cor. xi. 26), and who preferred
walking from Troas to Assos (Acts xx.
13) while his companions sailed, would
not be deterred by any rough or unfrequented
paths. But the facts adduced
by Perrot do not lend themselves
to any such inference, nor does
he himself draw it. He cites an inscription
of the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 82 which
speaks of A. Cæsennius Gallus, the
legate of Domitian, as a great road-maker
throughout the Eastern provinces
of Asia Minor, and he suggests
that the existing remains of a road between
Ancyra and Iconium may be
part of this governor’s work. Even if
the suggestion be adopted, it is highly
improbable that no road should have
existed previously, when we consider
the comparative facility of constructing
a way along this line of country
(Perrot p. 103) and the importance of
such a direct route. (<em>d</em>) ‘In the conception
of the author of the Acts,’
writes M. Renan, ‘the two journeys
across Asia Minor are journeys of confirmation
and not of conversion (Acts
xv. 36, 41, xvi. 5, 6, xviii. 23).’ This
statement seems to me to be only
partially true. In both cases St Paul
<em>begins</em> his tour by confirming churches
already established, but in both he
advances beyond this and breaks new
ground. In the former he starts with
the existing churches of Lycaonia and
Pisidia and extends his labours to
Galatia: in the latter he starts with
the then existing churches of Galatia,
and carries the Gospel into Macedonia
and Achaia. This, so far as I can discover,
was his general rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>(iii) The notices in the Galatian
Epistle, which appear to M. Renan to
favour his view, are these: (<em>a</em>) St Paul
appears to have ‘had intimate relations
with the Galatian Church, at
least as intimate as with the Corinthians
and Thessalonians,’ whereas St
Luke disposes of the Apostle’s preaching
in Galatia very summarily, unless the
communities of Lycaonia and Pisidia
be included. But the Galatian Epistle
by no means evinces the same
close and varied personal relations
which we find in the letters to these
other churches, more especially to the
Corinthians. And again; St Luke’s
history is more or less fragmentary.
Whole years are sometimes dismissed
in a few verses. The stay in Arabia
which made so deep an impression on
St Paul himself is not even mentioned:
the three months’ sojourn in
Greece, though doubtless full of stirring
events, only occupies a single
verse in the narrative (Acts xx. 3).
St Luke appears to have joined St
Paul after his visit to Galatia (xvi. 10);
and there is no reason why he should
have dwelt on incidents with which he
had no direct acquaintance. (<em>b</em>) M.
Renan sees in the presence of emissaries
from Jerusalem in the Galatian
Churches an indication that Galatia
proper is not meant. ‘It is improbable
that they would have made such a
journey.’ But why so? There were
important Jewish settlements in Galatia
proper (<cite>Galatians</cite> p. 9 sq.); there
was a good road through Syria and
Cilicia to Ancyra (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Itin. Anton.</cite></span> p. 205 sq.,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Itin. Hierosol.</cite></span> p. 575 sq. ed. Wessel.);
and if we find such emissaries as far
away from Jerusalem as Corinth (2 Cor.
xi. 13, etc.), there is at least no improbability
that they should have reached
Galatia. (<em>c</em>) Lastly; M. Renan thinks
that the mention of Barnabas (Gal. ii.
1, 9, 13) implies that he was personally
known to the churches addressed,
and therefore points to Lycaonia and
Pisidia. But are we to infer on the
same grounds that he was personally
known to the Corinthians (1 Cor. ix. 6),
and to the Colossians (Col. iv. 10)? In
fact the name of Barnabas, as a famous
Apostle and an older disciple even
than St Paul himself, would not fail to
be well known in all the churches.
On the other hand one or two notices
in the Galatian Epistle present serious
obstacles to M. Renan’s view. What
are we to say for instance to St Paul’s
statement, that he preached the Gospel
in Galatia  δι’ ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκός
(iv. 13), i.e. because he was detained by
sickness (see <cite>Galatians</cite> pp. 23 sq., 172),
whereas his journey to Lycaonia and
Pisidia is distinctly planned with a
view to missionary work? Why again
is there no mention of Timothy, who
was much in St Paul’s company about
this time, and who on this showing was
himself a Galatian? Some mention
would seem to be especially suggested
where St Paul is justifying his conduct
respecting the attempt to compel Titus
to be circumcised.</p>

αὐτῶν, συμβιβασθέντες κ.τ.λ. The
question of interpretation is whether
the people of Colossæ and Laodicea
belong to the same category with the
ὅσοι, or not. The latter view is taken
by one or two ancient interpreters
(e.g. Theodoret in his introduction to
the epistle), and has been adopted by
several modern critics. Yet it is opposed
alike to grammatical and logical
considerations. (1) The grammatical
form is unfavourable; for the preposition
ὑπὲρ is not repeated, so that all
the persons mentioned are included
under a vinculum. (2) No adequate
sense can be extracted from the passage,
so interpreted. For in this case
what is the drift of the enumeration?
If intended to be exhaustive, it does
not fulfil the purpose; for nothing is
said of others whom he had seen beside
the Colossians and Laodiceans.
If not intended to be exhaustive, it is
meaningless; for there is no reason
why the Colossians and Laodiceans
especially should be set off against
those whom he had not seen, or indeed
why in this connexion those whom
he had not seen should be mentioned
at all. The whole context shows that
the Apostle is dwelling on his spiritual
communion with and interest in those
with whom he has had no personal communications.
St Jerome (<cite>Ep.</cite> cxxx. ad
Demetr. § 2) has rightly caught the
spirit of the passage; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Ignoti ad ignotam
scribimus, dumtaxat juxta faciem
corporalem. Alioquin interior
homo pulcre sibi cognitus est illa
notitia qua et Paulus apostolus Colossenses
multosque credentium noverat
quos ante non viderat.’</span> For
parallels to this use of καὶ ὅσοι, see
the note on the passage.</p>

καὶ αὐξανόμενον, καθὼς καὶ
ἐν ὑμῖν, ἀφ’ ἤς ἡμέρας ἠκούσατε καὶ
ἐπέγνωτε τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ,
καθὼς ἐμάθετε ἀπὸ Ἐπαφρᾶ τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ

<p class='c000'>The various readings which obscure
the meaning are these. (i) The received
text for καθὼς ἐμάθετε has καθὼς
καὶ ἐμάθετε. With this reading the
passage suggests that the instructions
of Epaphras were <em>superadded to</em>, and
so distinct from, the original evangelization
of Colossæ; whereas the correct
text identifies them. (ii) For ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν
the received reading is ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν.
Thus the fact that St Paul did not
preach at Colossæ in person, but
<em>through his representative</em>, is obliterated.
In both cases the authority for
the readings which I have adopted
against the received text is overwhelming.</p>

<p class='c000'>The obscurity of rendering is in
καθὼς [καὶ] ἐμάθετε ἀπὸ Ἐπαφρᾶ, translated
in our English Version by the
ambiguous expression, ‘as ye also
learned of Epaphras.’ The true force
of the words is, ‘according as ye were
taught by Epaphras,’ being an explanation
of ἐν ἀληθείᾳ. See the notes
on the passage.]</p>

St Jerome on Philem. 23 (<span class='fss'>VII.</span> p.

when the Romans invaded and wasted
Judæa, were banished thence with their

may have been St Paul’s fellow-prisoner
at this time, and have been
removed with his parents to Colossæ.
It is not quite clear whether this

names being the same as those mentioned
by Tacitus with the addition of
Ephesus and Cibyra. There can be
no doubt that this was one of those
monuments mentioned by Apollonius
quoted in Phlegon (<cite>Fragm.</cite> 42, Müller’s
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Fragm. Hist. Græc.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 621) as
erected to commemorate the liberality
of Tiberius in contributing to the restoration
of the ruined cities (see Eckhel
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Doct. Num. Vet.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>VI.</span> 192 sq.). But no
earthquake at Ephesus is mentioned
by Tacitus. He does indeed speak of
such a catastrophe as happening at
Cibyra (<cite>Ann.</cite> iv. 13) six years later
than the one which ruined the twelve
cities, and of the relief which Tiberius
afforded on this latter occasion as on
the former. But we owe to Eusebius
alone the fact that Ephesus also was
seriously injured by an earthquake in
the same year—perhaps not on the
same night—with the twelve cities:
and this fact is necessary to explain
the monument. It should be added
that Nipperdey (on Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> ii. 47)
supposes the earthquake at Ephesus
to have been recorded in the lost portion
of the fifth book of the <cite>Annals</cite>
which comprised the years <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 29–31;
but this bare hypothesis cannot outweigh
the direct testimony of Eusebius.</p>

St Mark had some personal connexion
with Asia Minor in the years immediately
succeeding the date of this reference:
(1) St Peter, writing to the
Churches of Asia Minor, sends a salutation
from St Mark (1 Pet. v. 13);
(2) St Paul gives charge to Timothy,
who appears to be still residing at
Ephesus, to take up Mark and bring
him to Rome (2 Tim. iv. 11 Μάρκον
ἀναλαβὼν ἄγε μετὰ σεαυτοῦ). Thus it
seems fairly probable that St Mark’s
projected visit to Colossæ was paid.</p>

wrote to the Churches of Asia Minor
(1 Pet. i. 1). Whether in this interval
he also visited personally the districts
evangelized directly or indirectly by
St Paul, we have no means of deciding.
Such a visit is far from unlikely, but
it can hardly have been of long duration.
A copy of his letters would probably
be sent to Laodicea, as a principal
centre of Christianity in Proconsular
Asia, which is among the

παρθένοι, καὶ ἠ ἑτέρα αὐτοῦ θυγάτηρ ἐν
ἁγίῳ πνεύματι πολιτευσαμένη, ἣ ἐν
Ἐφέσῳ ἀναπαύεται. To this third
daughter the statement of Clement of
Alexandria must refer, though by a
common looseness of expression he
uses the plural number (Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite>
iii. 30), ἣ καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τοὺς ἀποστόλους</em>&nbsp; ἀποδοκιμάσουσι·
Πέτρος μὲν γὰρ καὶ Φίλιππος
ἐπαιδοποιήσαντο, Φίλιππος δὲ καὶ τὰς
θυγατέρας ἀνδράσιν ἐξέδωκε. On the
other hand in the <cite>Dialogue between
Caius and Proclus</cite>, Philip the Evangelist
was represented as residing at
Hierapolis (Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> iii. 31) μετὰ
τοῦτον δὲ προφήτιδες τέσσαρες αἱ Φίλιππου
γεγένηνται ἐν Ἱεραπόλει τῇ κατὰ
τὴν Ἀσίαν· ὁ τάφος αὐτῶν ἐστὶν ἐκεῖ, καὶ
ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν, where the mention
of the <em>four</em> daughters <em>prophesying</em> identifies
the person meant (see Acts xxi.
8). Nothing can be clearer than that
St Luke distinguishes Philip the Evangelist
from Philip the Apostle; for
(1) When the Seven are appointed, he
distinctly states that this new office
is created to relieve the Twelve of some
onerous duties (Acts vi. 2–5). (2) After
Philip the Evangelist has preached
in Samaria, two of the Twelve are sent
thither to convey the gifts of the Spirit,
which required the presence of an
Apostle (viii. 14–17). (3) When St
Paul and his companions visit Philip
at Cæsarea, he is carefully described
as ‘the Evangelist, being one of the
Seven’ (xxi. 8). As St Luke was a
member of the Apostle’s company
when this visit was paid, and stayed
‘many days’ in Philip’s house, the
accuracy of his information cannot be
questioned. Yet Eusebius (<cite>H.E.</cite> iii.
31) assumes the identity of the Apostle
with the Evangelist, and describes the
notice in the <cite>Dialogue of Caius and
Proclus</cite> as being ‘in harmony with
(συνᾴδων)’ the language of Polycrates.
And accordingly in another passage
(<cite>H.E.</cite> iii. 39), when he has occasion
to mention the conversations of Papias
with Philip’s daughters at Hierapolis,
he again supposes them to be the same
who are mentioned in the Acts.</p>

<p class='c000'>My reasons for believing that the
Philip who lived at Hierapolis was not
the Evangelist, but the Apostle, are as
follows. (1) This is distinctly stated
by the earliest witness, Polycrates,
who was bishop of Ephesus at the
close of the second century, and who
besides claimed to have and probably
had special opportunities of knowing
early traditions. It is confirmed moreover
by the notice in Clement of
Alexandria, who is the next in order
of time, and whose means of information
also were good, for one of
his earliest teachers was an Ionian
Greek (<cite>Strom.</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> 1, p. 322). (2) The
other view depends solely on the authority
of the <cite>Dialogue of Caius and
Proclus</cite>. I have given reasons elsewhere
for questioning the separate existence
of the Roman presbyter Caius,
and for supposing that this dialogue
was written by Hippolytus bishop of
Portus (<cite>Journal of Philology</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 98
sq., Cambridge, 1868). But however
this may be, its author was a Roman
ecclesiastic, and probably wrote some
quarter of a century at least after
Polycrates. In all respects therefore
his authority is inferior. Moreover
it is suspicious in form. It mentions
four daughters instead of three, makes
them all virgins, and represents them
as prophetesses, thus showing a distinct
aim of reproducing the particulars
as given in Acts xxi. 9; whereas
the account of Polycrates is divergent
in all three respects. (3) A life-long
friendship would naturally draw Philip
the Apostle of Bethsaida after John,
as it also drew Andrew. And, when
we turn to St John’s Gospel, we can
hardly resist the impression that incidents
relating to Andrew and Philip
had a special interest, not only for
the writer of the Gospel, but also for
his hearers (John i. 40, 43–46, vi.
5–8, xii. 20–22, xiv. 8, 9). Moreover
the Apostles Andrew and Philip appear
in this Gospel as inseparable companions.
(4) Lastly; when Papias mentions
collecting the sayings of the
Twelve and of other early disciples
from those who heard them, he gives
a prominent place to these two Apostles
τί Ἀνδρέας ... εἶπεν ἢ τί Φίλιππος,
but there is no reference to Philip the
Evangelist. When therefore we read
later that he conversed with the
daughters of Philip, it seems natural
to infer that the Philip intended is
the same person whom he has mentioned
previously. It should be added,
though no great value can be assigned
to such channels of information,
that the Acts of Philip place the
Apostle at Hierapolis; Tischendorf,
<cite>Act. Apost. Apocr.</cite> p. 75 sq.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, those who suppose
that the Evangelist, and not
the Apostle, resided at Hierapolis, account
for the other form of the tradition
by the natural desire of the
Asiatic Churches to trace their spiritual
descent directly from the Twelve. This
solution of the phenomenon might have
been accepted, if the authorities in
favour of Philip the Evangelist had
been prior in time and superior in
quality. There is no improbability
in supposing that both the Philips
were married and had daughters.</p>

I have collected and investigated all
the notices of this father. The object
of Papias’ work was not to construct
a Gospel narrative, but to interpret
and illustrate those already existing.
I ought to add that on two minor
points, the martyrdom of Papias and
the identity of Philip with the Evangelist,
I have been led to modify my

that even Irenæus mentions similar
miracles as occurring in his own age

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f160'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r160'>160</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Papias, or (as it is very frequently
written in inscriptions) Pappias, is a
common Phrygian name. It is found
several times at Hierapolis, not only
in inscriptions (Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Corp. Inscr.</cite></span>
no. 3930, 3912 a add.) but even on
coins (Mionnet <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 301). This is
explained by the fact that it was
an epithet of the Hierapolitan Zeus
(Boeckh 3817 Παπίᾳ Διῒ σωτῆρι), just as
in Bithynia this same god was called
Πάπας (Lobeck <cite>Aglaoph.</cite> p. 1048; see
Boeckh <cite>Corp. Inscr.</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 1051).
Hence as the name of a mortal it is
equivalent to the Greek Diogenes; e.g.
Boeckh no. 3912 a add., Παπίας τοῦ
Στράτωνος ὁ καλούμενος Διογένης. In
an inscription at Trajanopolis we meet
with it in a curious conjunction with
other familiar names (Boeckh no. 3865 i
add.) Παππίας Τροφίμου καὶ Τυχικῆς
κ.τ.λ. (see Waddington on Le Bas, Inscr.
no. 718). This last belongs to the
year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 199. Other analogous Phrygian
names are Ammias, Tatias (with
the corresponding feminines), which
with Latin terminations become Ammianus,
Tatianus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus at Hierapolis the name Papias
is derived from heathen mythology,
and accordingly the persons bearing it
on the inscriptions and coins are all
heathens. It may therefore be presumed
that our Papias was of Gentile
origin. The inference however is not
absolutely certain, since elsewhere it is
found borne by Jews; see the Talmudical
references in Zunz <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Namen der

In his history (iv. 15) Eusebius, after

κ.τ.λ. He here falls into the
serious error of imagining that Metrodorus,
Pionius, Carpus, Papylus, and
the others were martyred under M.
Aurelius, whereas we know from their
extant Acts that they suffered in the
Decian persecution. For the martyrdoms
of Pionius and Metrodorus see
<cite>Act. SS. Bolland.</cite> Feb. 1; for those of
Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonica, <em>ib.</em>
April 13. The Acts of the former,
which are included in Ruinart (<cite>Act.
Sinc. Mart.</cite> p. 120 sq., 1689) are apparently
the same which were seen by
Eusebius. Those of the latter are a
late compilation of the Metaphrast,
but  were  probably founded on the
earlier document.  At all events the
tradition of the persecution in which
they suffered could hardly have been
perverted or lost. Eusebius seems to
have found their Acts bound up in the
same volume with those of Polycarp,
and without reading them through, to
have drawn the hasty inference that
they suffered at the same time. But
notwithstanding the error, or perhaps
owing to it, this passage in the Ecclesiastical
History, by a confusion of the
names Papias and Papylus, seems to
have given rise to the statement respecting
Papias in the Chronicon Paschale
and in the Syrian epitome, as it
obviously has misled Jerome respecting
Pionius.  If so, the martyrdom
of Papias is a fiction, and he may have
died a natural death at an earlier
date; so that the not very serious difficulty
of his longevity will disappear.
The time of Polycarp’s martyrdom
is fixed by various data as Easter

This is all that Eusebius
says with reference to Polycarp’s knowledge
of the Canonical writings. It
so happens that in an earlier passage
(iii. 36) he has given an extract from
Polycarp, in which St Paul’s name
is mentioned; but the quotation is
brought to illustrate the life of Ignatius,
and the mention of the Apostle
there is purely accidental.</p>

because though it has never been

quite unanswerable, yet thoughtful
men, who have no sympathy with the
Tübingen views of early Christian history,
still continue to argue from the
silence of Eusebius, as though it had
some real significance. To illustrate the
omissions of Eusebius I have given
only the instances of Polycarp and
Irenæus, because they are historically
connected with Papias; but his silence
is even more remarkable in other cases.
Thus, when speaking of the epistle of
the Roman Clement (<cite>H.E.</cite> iii. 38), he
alludes to the coincidences with the
Epistle to the Hebrews, but omits to
mention the direct references to St
Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians

in the Bollandist <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Acta Sanctorum</cite></span>
Oct. 22. It may safely be pronounced
spurious. Among other incidents, the
saint goes to Rome and casts out a
demon from Lucilla, the daughter of
M. Aurelius and Faustina, at the same
time compelling the demon to take up
an altar from Rome and transport it
through the air to Hierapolis. But
these Acts, though legendary themselves,
contain an epitaph which has
the ring of genuineness and which
seems to have suggested the story to
the pious forger who invented the
Acts. This very interesting memorial
is given and discussed at length by
Pitra, <cite>Spicil. Solesm.</cite> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 532 sq. It is
inscribed by one Abercius of Hierapolis
on his tomb, which he erected during
his life-time. He declares himself a
disciple of the good shepherd, who
taught him trustworthy writings (γράμματα
πιστά) and sent him to visit
queenly Rome, where he saw a people
sealed with the bright seal [of baptism].
He recounts also a journey to
Syria and the East, when he crossed
the Euphrates.  He says that faith
served up to him as a banquet the
<span class='large'>ιχθυς</span> from the fountain, giving him
bread and wine. He states that he
has reached his 72nd year. And he
closes by threatening with severe penalties
those who disturb his tomb.
The resemblance of this inscription to
others found <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>in situ</em></span> in the cemetery at
Hierapolis, after allowance made for
the Christian element, is very striking.
The commencement Ἐκλεκτῆς πόλεως
closely resembles the form of another
Hierapolitan inscription, Boeckh <cite>Corp.
Inscr.</cite> 3906;  the enumeration of foreign
tours has a counterpart in the
monument of one Flavius Zeuxis which
states that the deceased had made 72
voyages round the promontory of Malea
to Italy (<em>ib.</em> 3920); and lastly, the
prohibition against putting another
grave upon his, and the imposition of
fines to be paid to the treasury and
the city if this injunction is violated,
are echos of language which occurs
again and again on tombstones in this
city (<em>ib.</em> 3915, 3916, 3922, 3923, etc.).
Out of this epitaph, which he found
probably at Hierapolis, and which, as he
himself tells us (§ 41), was in a much
mutilated condition, the legend-writer
apparently created his story, interpreting
the queen, by which Abercius himself
probably meant the city of Rome, to
be the empress Faustina, with whom
the saint is represented as having an
interview, M. Aurelius himself being
absent at the time on his German campaign.
This view, that the epitaph is
genuine and gave rise to the Acts, is
also maintained by Garrucci (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Civiltà
Cattolica</cite></span> 1856, <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 683, <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 84, quoted
in the <cite>Acta Sanct.</cite> l.c.), whose criticisms
however are not always sound;
and indeed as a whole it bears every
mark of authenticity, though possibly
it may contain some interpolations,
which its mutilated condition would
encourage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscription itself however does
not tell us what office Abercius held or
when he lived. There was a person of
this name bishop of Hierapolis present
at the Council of Chalcedon <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 451
(Labb. <cite>Conc.</cite>  <span class='fss'>IV.</span> 862, 1204, 1341, 1392,
1496, 1744, ed. Coleti). But a chief pastor
of the Church at this late date would
have declared his office plainly; and the
inscription points to a more primitive
age, for the expressions are archaic and
the writer seems to veil his profession of
Christianity under language studiously
obscure. The open profession of Christianity
on inscriptions occurs at an
earlier date in these parts than elsewhere.
Already the word <span class='large'>χριϲτιανοϲ</span>
or <span class='large'>χρηϲτιανοϲ</span> is found on tombstones
of the third century; Boeckh
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Corp. Inscr.</cite></span> 3857 g, 3857 p, 3865 l; see
Renan <cite>Saint Paul</cite> p. 363. Thus we
are entirely at fault unless we accept
the statement in the Acts.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it is not unreasonable to suppose
that, so far as regards the date
and office of Abercius, the writer of
these Acts followed some adequate historical
tradition. Nor indeed is his
statement altogether without confirmation.
We have evidence that a person
bearing this name lived in these
parts of Asia Minor, somewhere about
this time. An unknown writer of a
polemical tract against Montanism dedicates
his work to one Avircius Marcellus,
at whose instigation it was
written. Eusebius (<cite>H.E.</cite> v. 16), who
is our authority for this fact, relates
that Montanism found a determined
and formidable opponent in Apollinaris
at Hierapolis and ‘several other
learned men of that day with him,’
who left large materials for a history
of the movement. He then goes
on to say; ἀρχόμενος γοῦν τῆς κατ’
αὐτῶν γραφῆς &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>τῶν εἰρημένων δή τις</em>&nbsp;
... προοιμιάζεται ... τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον· Ἐκ
πλείστου ὅσου καὶ ἱκανωτάτου χρόνου,
ἀγαπητὲ Ἀουίρκιε Μάρκελλε, ἐπιταχθεὶς
ὑπὸ σοῦ συγγράψαι τινὰ λόγον κ.τ.λ.,
i.e. ‘One of the aforesaid writers at
the commencement of his treatise
against them (the Montanists) etc.’
May not the person here addressed be
the Abercius of the epitaph?</p>

<p class='c000'>But if so, who is the writer that
addresses him, and when did he live?
Some <span class='fss'>MSS</span> omit δή τις, and others
substitute ἤδη, thus making Apollinaris
himself the writer. But the words
seem certainly to have been part of
the original text, as the sense requires
them; for if they are omitted, τῶν εἰρημένων
must be connected with κατ’
αὐτῶν, where it is not wanted. Thus
Eusebius quotes the writer anonymously;
and those who assign the treatise
to Apollinaris cannot plead the
authority of the original text of the
historian himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>But after all may it not have been
written by Apollinaris, though Eusebius
was uncertain about the authorship?
He quotes in succession three
συγγράμματα or treatises, speaking of
them as though they emanated from
the same author. The first of these,
from which the address to Avircius
Marcellus is quoted, might very well
have been composed soon after the
Montanist controversy broke out (as
Eusebius himself elsewhere states was
the case with the work of Apollinaris,
iv. 27  κατὰ τῆς τῶν  Φρυγῶν αἱρέσεως
... ὥσπερ ἐκφύειν ἀρχομένης); but the
second and third distinctly state that
they were written some time after the
death of Montanus. May not Eusebius
have had before him a volume
containing a collection of tracts against
Montanism ‘by Claudius Apollinaris
and others,’ in which the authorship
of the several tracts was not distinctly
marked? This hypothesis would explain
the words with which he prefaces
his extracts, and would also account
for his vague manner of quotation.
It would also explain the omission
of δή τις in some texts (the
ancient Syriac version boldly substitutes
the name of Apollinaris), and
would explain how Rufinus, Nicephorus,
and others, who might have had
independent information, ascribed the
treatise to this father. I have already
pointed out how Eusebius was
led into a similar error of connecting
together several martyrologies and
treating them as contemporaneous, because
they were collected in the same
volume (p. 48, note <a href='#f161'>161</a>). Elsewhere
too I have endeavoured to show that
he mistook the authorship of a tract
which was bound up with others,
owing to the absence of a title (<cite>Caius
or Hippolytus?</cite> in the <cite>Journal of Philology</cite>
<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 98 sq.).</p>

<p class='c000'>On this hypothesis, Claudius Apollinaris
would very probably be the
author of the first of these treatises.
If so, it would appear to have been
written while he was still a presbyter,
at the instigation of his bishop Avircius
Marcellus whom he succeeded not
long after in the see of Hierapolis.</p>

<p class='c000'>If on the other hand Eusebius has
correctly assigned the first treatise to
the same writer as the second and
third, who must have written after the
beginning of the third century, Avircius
Marcellus to whom it is addressed
cannot have held the see of Hierapolis
during the reign of M. Aurelius (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
161–180); and, if he was ever bishop
of this city, must have been a successor,
not a predecessor, of Claudius Apollinaris.
In this case we have the alternative
of abandoning the identification
of this Avircius with the Hierapolitan
bishop of the same name, or of
rejecting the statement of the Acts
which places his episcopate in this
reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>The occurrence of the name Abercius
in the later history of the see of
Hierapolis (see p. <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>) is no argument
against the existence of this earlier
bishop. It was no uncommon practice
for the later occupants of sees to assume
the name of some famous predecessor
who lived in primitive or early times.
The case of Ignatius at Antioch is only
one of several examples which might
be produced.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is some ground for supposing
that, like Papias and Apollinaris,
Abercius earned a place in literary
history. Baronio had in his hands an
epistle to M. Aurelius, purporting to
have been written by this Abercius,
which he obviously considered genuine
and which he describes as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘apostolicum
redolens spiritum,’</span> promising to
publish it in his Annals (<cite>Martyr. Rom.</cite>
Oct. 22). To his great grief however
he afterwards lost it (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘doluimus vehementer
e manibus nostris elapsam
nescio quomodo’</span>), and was therefore
unable to fulfil his promise (<cite>Annal.</cite> s. a.
163, n. 15). A βίβλος διδασκαλίας by
Abercius is mentioned in the Acts
(§ 39); but this, if it ever existed, was
doubtless spurious.</p>

3842 c, 3846 z (<em>ib.</em> pp. 1069, 1078) at
the same place, where again the name
Apollinarius occurs. It is found also
at Appia no. 3857 b (<em>ib.</em> p. 1086). At an
earlier date one Claudius Apollinaris
appears in command of the Roman
fleet at Misenum (Tac. <cite>Hist.</cite> iii. 57, 76,
77). The name occurs also at Hierapolis
itself, Boeckh, no. 3915. <span class="uncial">π .

Latin form, the latter being the Greek
adaptation.</p>

council is not mentioned elsewhere,
there is no sufficient ground for questioning
its authenticity. The important
part taken by Apollinaris against
the Montanists is recognised by Eusebius
<cite>H.E.</cite> v. 16, πρὸς τὴν λεγομένην
κατὰ Φρύγας ἅιρεσιν ὅπλον ἰσχυρὸν καὶ
ἀκαταγώνιστον ἐπὶ τῆς Ἱεραπόλεως τὸν

<p class='c000'>After mentioning the council the
compiler of this Synodicon speaks thus
of the false prophets; οἳ καὶ βλασφήμως,
ἤτοι δαιμονῶντες, καθώς φησιν ὁ
αὐτὸς πατήρ [<em>i.e.</em> Ἀπολινάριος], τὸν βίον
κατέστρεψαν, σὺν αὐτοῖς δὲ κατέκρινε
καὶ Θεόδοτον τὸν σκυτέα. He evidently
has before him the fragments of the
anonymous treatises quoted by Eusebius
(<cite>H.E.</cite> v. 16), as the following
parallels taken from these fragments
shew: ὡς ἐπὶ ἐνεργουμένῳ καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>δαιμονῶντι</em>&nbsp;
... &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>βλασφημεῖν</em>&nbsp; διδάσκοντος τοῦ

αἱρεῖ λόγος ... τετελευτήκασι Μοντανός τε
καὶ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>Θεόδοτος</em>&nbsp; και ἡ προειρημένη γυνή.
Thus he must have had before him a
text of Eusebius which omitted the
words δή τις at the commencement, as
they are omitted in some existing
<span class='fss'>MSS</span> (see above, p. 56, <a href='#f172'>note</a>); and accordingly
he ascribed all the treatises
to Apollinaris. The parallels are
taken from the first and second treatises;
the first might have been written
by Apollinaris, but the second was
certainly not by his hand, as it refers
to much later events (see above,
p. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Hefele (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Conciliengeschichte</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p.
71) places the date of this council
before <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 150. But if the testimony
of Eusebius is worth anything, this is
impossible; for he states that the
writings of Claudius Apollinaris against
the Montanists were later than
his Apology to M. Aurelius (see p. 59,
note <a href='#f183'>183</a>), and this Apology was not
written till after <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 174 (see p. 61,
note <a href='#f187'>187</a>). The chronology of Montanism
is very perplexing, but Hefele’s dates
appear to be much too early. The
<cite>Chronicon</cite> of Eusebius gives the rise
of Montanism under <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 172 or 173,
and this statement is consistent with
the notices in his History. But if
this date be correct, it most probably
refers to Montanism as a distinct
system; and the fires had probably
been smouldering within the Church
for some time before they broke out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be observed that the writer
of the Synodicon identifies Theodotus
the Montanist (see Euseb. <cite>H.E.</cite> v. 3)
with Theodotus the leather-seller who
was a Monarchian. There is no authority

ambiguous expression implying that
it was fitly so named (<em>e.g.</em> ἐπώνυμον
τῆς συντυχίας), which Eusebius and
later writers misunderstood; just as
Eusebius himself (v. 24) speaks of
Irenæus as φερώνυμός τις ὢν τῇ προσηγορίᾳ
αὐτῷ τε τῷ τρόπῳ εἰρηνοποίος. Of
the words used by Eusebius, οἰκείαν τῷ
γεγονότι πρὸς τοῦ βασιλέως εἰληφέναι
προσηγορίαν, we may suspect that οἰκείαν
τῷ γεγονότι προσηγορίαν is an expression
borrowed from Apollinaris
himself, while πρὸς τοῦ βασιλέως εἰληφέναι
gives Eusebius’ own erroneous

have been bishop of the <em>Phrygian</em>

the bishop of the <em>Syrian</em> Hierapolis

Stephanus (Labb. <cite>Conc.</cite> <span class='fss'>IV.</span> 727, 1506,

which Wiltsch (<cite>Geography and Statistics

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r208'>208</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This council cannot have been
held earlier than the year 344, as the
7th canon makes mention of the Photinians,
and Photinus did not attract
notice before that year: see Hefele,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Conciliengesch.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 722 sq. In the
ancient lists of Councils it stands after
that of Antioch (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 341), and before
that of Constantinople (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 381).
Dr Westcott (<cite>History of the Canon</cite>,
p. 400) is inclined to place it about
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 363, and this is the time very
generally adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here however a difficulty presents
itself, which has not been noticed
hitherto. In the Syriac <span class='fss'>MS</span> <cite>Brit. Mus.</cite>
Add. 14,528, are lists of the bishops
present at the earlier councils, including
Laodicea (see Wright’s <cite>Catalogue of
the Syriac MSS in the British Museum</cite>,
<span class='fss'>DCCCVI</span>, p. 1030 sq.). These lists have
been published by Cowper (<cite>Syriac
Miscell.</cite> p. 42 sq., <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Analecta Nicæna</cite></span>
p. 36), who however has transposed
the lists of Antioch and Laodicea, so
that he ascribes to the Antiochian
Synod the names which really belong
to the Laodicean. This is determined
(as I am informed by Prof. Wright)
by the position of the lists.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Laodicean list then, which seems
to be imperfect, contains twenty names;
and, when examined, it yields these results.
(1) At least three-fourths of the
names can be identified with bishops
who sat at Nicæa, and probably the
exceptions would be fewer, if in some
cases they had not been obscured by
transcription into Syriac and by the
errors of copyists. (2) When identified,
they are found to belong in almost
every instance to C&oelig;lesyria, Ph&oelig;nicia,
Palestine, Cilicia, and Isauria, whereas
apparently not one comes from Phrygia,
Lydia, or the other western districts
of Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Supposing that this is a genuine
Laodicean list, we are led by the first
result to place it as near in time as
possible to the Council of Nicæa;
and by the second to question whether
after all the Syrian Laodicea may not
have been meant instead of the Phrygian.
On the other hand tradition is
unanimous in placing this synod in
the Phrygian town, and in this very
Syriac <span class='fss'>MS</span> the heading of the canons
begins ‘Of the Synod of Laodicea of
Phrygia.’ On the whole it appears
probable that this supposed list of
bishops who met at Laodicea belongs
to some other Council. The Laodicean
Synod seems to have been, as Dr
Westcott describes it (l.c.), ‘A small
gathering of clergy from parts of
Lydia and Phrygia.’</p>

<p class='c000'>In a large mosaic in the Church
at Bethlehem, in which all the more
important Councils are represented,
we find the following inscription; [Ἡ]
ἁγία σύνοδος ἡ ἐν Λαοδικείᾳ τῆς Φρυγίας
των κὲ ἐπισκόπων γέγονεν διὰ Μοντανὸν
κὲ [τ]ὰ[ς] λοιπὰς ἑρέσεις· τού[τους] ὡς

Sacr. Ædif. a Constant. constr.</cite></span> p. 156;
comp. Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Corp. Inscr.</cite></span> 8953). From
its position we might infer that the
synod to which this inscription refers
was supposed to have taken place before
the Council of Nicæa; and if so,
it may have been one of those Asiatic
synods held against Montanism at
the end of the second or beginning of
the third century. But, inasmuch as
no record of any such synod is preserved
elsewhere, we must probably
refer it to the well-known Council of
Laodicea in the fourth century. In
this case however the description is
not very correct, for though Montanism
is incidentally condemned in the eighth
canon, yet this condemnation was not
the main object of the council and occupies
a very subordinate place. The
Bethlehem mosaics were completed

appended (sometimes as a 60th canon)

the Laodicean Council, commenting on
Col. ii. 18, states that this disease
(τὸ πάθος) which St Paul denounces
‘long remained in Phrygia and Pisidia.’
‘For this reason also,’ he
adds, ‘a synod convened in Laodicea
of Phrygia forbad by a decree
the offering prayer to angels; and
even to the present time oratories of
the holy Michael may be seen among
them and their neighbours.’ See
also below p. 71, note <a href='#f219'>219</a>. A curious
inscription, found in the theatre
at Miletus (Boeckh <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>C. I.</cite></span> 2895), illustrates
this tendency. It is an inscription
in seven columns, each having a
different planetary symbol, and a different
permutation of the vowels with
the same invocation <span class="uncial">αγιε . φυλατον .
την . πολιν . μιληϲιων . και .

<p class='c000'>From this time forward Hierapolis

the circumstances under which the
change was made. In the <cite>Notitiæ</cite> it

see of Phrygia Salutaris, and
secondly as metropolis of another
Phrygia Pacatiana (distinct from that
which has Laodicea for its metropolis):

In this latter position it is placed
quite out of the proper geographical
order, thus showing that its metropolitan
jurisdiction was created comparatively
late. The number of dioceses
in the province is generally given as
9; Nilus <em>ib.</em> p. 301. The name of the
province is variously corrupted from
Πακατιανῆς, e.g. Καππατιανῆς, Καππαδοκίας.
Unless the ecclesiastical position

as a province within a province,
its double mention in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Notitiæ</cite></span>

Curopalata refers. The people were in

Michael appeared and opened a

The views maintained by some earlier
critics, who regarded them as (1) Jews,
or (2) Greek philosophers, or (3) Chaldean
magi, have found no favour and
do not need serious consideration. See
Meyer’s introduction for an enumeration

etc. p. 250 sq.) contends strenuously
for the separation of the two
elements. He argues that ‘these two
tendencies are related to one another
as fire and water, and nothing stands
in the way of allowing the author after
the first side-glance at the Gnostics to
pass over with ver. 11 to the Judaizers,
with whom Col. ii. 16 sq. is exclusively
concerned.’ He supposes therefore
that ii. 8–10 refers to ‘pure Gnostics,’
and ii. 16–23 to ‘pure Judaizers.’
To this it is sufficient to answer (1)
That, if the two elements be so antagonistic,
they managed nevertheless
to reconcile their differences; for we
find them united in several Judæo-Gnostic
heresies in the first half of
the second century, ξυνώμοσαν γάρ,
ὄντες ἔχθιστοι τὸ πρίν, πῦρ καὶ θάλασσα,
καὶ τὰ πίστ’ ἐδειξάτην; (2) That the
two passages are directly connected
together by τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου,
which occurs in both vv. 8, 20; (3)
That it is not a simple transition once
for all from the Gnostic to the Judaic
element, but the epistle passes to and
fro several times from the one to the
other; while no hint is given that two
separate heresies are attacked, but on
the contrary the sentences are connected
in a logical sequence (e.g. ver.
9 ὅτι, 10 ὃς, 11 ἐν ᾧ, 12 ἐν ᾧ, 13 καὶ,
16 οὖν). I hope to make this point clear
in my notes on the passage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hypothesis of more than one
heresy is maintained also by Heinrichs
(Koppe N. T. <span class='fss'>VII.</span> Part 2, 1803). At
an earlier date it seems to be favoured
by Grotius (notes on ii. 16, 21); but
his language is not very explicit. And
earlier still Calvin in his argument to
the epistle writes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Putant aliqui duo
fuisse hominum genera, qui abducere
tentarent Colossenses ab evangelii puritate,’</span>
but rejects this view as uncalled
for.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same question is raised with
regard to the heretical teachers of the
Pastoral Epistles, and should probably
be answered in the same way.</p>

the Carpocratians and Cainites: of the

ii. 32. 1 sq., Hippol. <cite>Hær.</cite> vii. 32, Epiphan.
<cite>Hær.</cite> xxvii. 2 sq.; from which
passages it appears that they justified
their moral profligacy on the principle
that the highest perfection consists in
the most complete contempt of mundane
things.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f235'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r235'>235</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It will be seen from the description
in the text, that Gnosticism (as
I have defined it) presupposes only a
belief in one God, the absolute Being,
as against the vulgar polytheism. All
its <em>essential</em> features, as a speculative
system, may be explained from this
simple element of belief, without any
intervention of specially Christian or
even Jewish doctrine. Christianity
added two new elements to it; (1) the
idea of <em>Redemption</em>, (2) the person of
<em>Christ</em>. To explain the former, and to
find a place for the latter, henceforth
become prominent questions which
press for solution; and Gnosticism in
its several developments undergoes
various modifications in the endeavour
to solve them. Redemption must be
set in some relation to the fundamental
Gnostic conception of the antagonism
between God and matter; and
Christ must have some place found
for Him in the fundamental Gnostic
doctrine of emanations.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it be urged that there is no authority
for the name ‘Gnostic’ as applied
to these pre-Christian theosophists, I
am not concerned to prove the contrary,
as my main position is not
affected thereby. The term ‘Gnostic’
is here used, only because no other is so
convenient, or so appropriate. See
note <a href='#f239'>239</a>, p. 81.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f236'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r236'>236</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This question will require closer
investigation when I come to discuss
the genuineness of the Epistle to the
Colossians. Meanwhile I content myself
with referring to Baur <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Christliche
Gnosis</cite></span> p. 29 sq. and Lipsius <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Gnosticismus</cite></span>
p. 230 sq. Both these writers
concede, and indeed insist upon, the
non-Christian basis of Gnosticism, at
least so far as I have maintained it in
the text. Thus for instance Baur
says (p. 52), ‘Though Christian gnosis
is the completion of gnosis, yet the
Christian element in gnosis is not so
essential as that gnosis cannot still be
gnosis even without this element. But
just as we can abstract it from the
Christian element, so can we also go still
further and regard even the Jewish as
not strictly an essential element of
gnosis.’ In another work (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die drei ersten
Jahrhunderte</cite></span>, p. 167, 1st ed.) he expresses
himself still more strongly to
the same effect, but the expressions
are modified in the second edition.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f237'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r237'>237</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We may perhaps gather from the
notices which are preserved that, though
the substantive γνῶσις was used with
more or less precision even before contact
with Christianity to designate the
superior illumination of these opinions,
the adjective γνωστικοί was not distinctly
applied to those who maintained
them till somewhat later. Still it is
possible that pre-Christian Gnostics
already so designated themselves.
Hippolytus speaks of the Naassenes
or Ophites as giving themselves
this name; <cite>Hær.</cite> v. 6 μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα
ἐπεκάλεσαν ἑαυτοὺς γνωστικοὺς, φάσκοντες
μόνοι τὰ βάθη γινώσκειν; comp. §§ 8,
11. His language seems to imply
(though it is not explicit) that they
were the first to adopt the name. The
Ophites were plainly among the earliest
Gnostic sects, as the heathen element
is still predominant in their teaching,
and their Christianity seems to have
been a later graft on their pagan theosophy;
but at what stage in their
development they adopted the name
γνωστικοί does not appear. Irenæus
(<cite>Hær.</cite> i. 25. 6) speaks of the name as
affected especially by the Carpocratians.
For the use of the substantive
γνῶσις see 1 Cor. viii. 1, xiii. 2, 8, 1 Tim.
vi. 20, and the note on Col. ii. 3: comp.
Rev. ii. 24 ὄιτινες οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰ βαθέα

who wrote a work <cite>On the Jews</cite> (Clem.

has a certain value. All other authorities

Hippolytus (<cite>Hær.</cite> ix. 25) omits the

as a stumbling-block. How Josephus
expressed himself in the original Hebrew

the language of Josephus may be ambiguous,
that of Philo is unequivocal

considered apart from the fact that they
ate no animal food: see above p. 86,

might seem at first sight to refer simply
to the <em>medicinal</em> qualities of vegetable
and mineral substances; but a comparison
with another notice in Josephus invests
it with a different meaning. In <cite>Ant.</cite>
viii. 2. 5 he states that Solomon, having
received by divine inspiration the art
of defeating demons for the advantage
and healing of man (εἰς ὠφέλειαν καὶ
θεραπείαν τοῖς ἀνθρῶποις), composed and
left behind him charms (ἐπῳδάς) by
which diseases were allayed, and diverse
kinds of exorcisms (τρόπους ἐξορκώσεων)
by which demons were cast out. ‘This
mode of healing,’ he adds, ‘is very
powerful even to the present day’; and
he then relates how, as he was credibly
informed (ἱστόρησα), one of his countrymen,
Eleazar by name, had healed
several persons possessed by demons
in the presence of Vespasian and his
sons and a number of officers and common
soldiers. This he did by applying
to the nose of the possessed his
ring, which had concealed in it one
of the <em>roots</em> which Solomon had directed
to be used, and thus drawing out
the demon through the nostrils of the
person smelling it. At the same time
he adjured the evil spirit not to return,
‘making mention of Solomon
and repeating the charms composed
by him.’ On one occasion this Eleazar
gave ocular proof that the
demon was exorcized; and thus, adds
Josephus, σαφὴς ἡ Σολομῶνος καθίστατο
σύνεσις καὶ σοφία. On these books relating
to the occult arts and ascribed to
Solomon see Fabricius <cite>Cod. Pseud.
Vet. Test.</cite> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 1036 sq., where many

<p class='c000'>This interpretation explains all the
expressions in the passage. The λίθων
ἰδιότητες naturally points to the use of
charms or amulets, as may be seen e.g.
from the treatise, Damigeron <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Lapidibus</cite></span>,
printed in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Spicil. Solemn.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span>
p. 324 sq.: comp. King <cite>Antique Gems</cite>
Sect. <span class='fss'>IV</span>, <cite>Gnostics and their Remains</cite>.
The reference to ‘the books of the ancients’
thus finds an adequate explanation.
On the other hand the only
expression which seemed to militate
against this view, ἀλεξιτήριοι ῥίζαι, is
justified by the story in the <cite>Antiquities</cite>.
It should be added also that
Hippolytus (<cite>Hær.</cite> ix. 22) paraphrases
the language of Josephus so as to give
it this sense; πάνυ δὲ &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>περιέργως</em>&nbsp;
ἔχουσι περὶ βοτάνας καὶ λίθους, &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>περιεργότεροι</em>&nbsp;
ὄντες πρὸς τὰς τούτων ἐνεργείας,
φάσκοντες μὴ μάτην ταῦτα γενονέναι.
The sense which περίεργος (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘curiosus’</span>)
bears in Acts xix. 19 and elsewhere,
referring to magical arts, illustrates
its use here.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus these Essenes were dealers in
charms, rather than physicians. And
yet it is quite possible that along with
this practice of the occult sciences they
studied the healing art in its nobler
forms. The works of Alexander of
Tralles, an eminent ancient physician,
constantly recommend the use of such
charms, of which some obviously come
from a Jewish source and not improbably
may have been taken from these
Solomonian books to which Josephus
refers. A number of passages from
this and other writers, specifying
charms of various kinds, are given in

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r263'>263</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have said nothing of the Cabbala,
as a development of Jewish
thought illustrating the Colossian heresy:
because the books containing
the Cabbalistic speculations are comparatively
recent, and if they contain
ancient elements, it seems impossible
to separate these from later additions
or to assign to them even an approximate
date. The Cabbalistic doctrine
however will serve to show to what
extent Judaism may be developed in
the direction of speculative mysticism.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f272'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r272'>272</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I can only regard it as an accidental
coincidence that the epulones of the
Ephesian Artemis were called <em>Essenes</em>,
Pausan. viii. 13. 1 τοὺς τῇ Ἀρτέμιδι
ἱστιάτορας τῇ Ἐφεσίᾳ γινομένους, καλουμένους
δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν πολιτῶν Ἐσσῆνας: see
Guhl <cite>Ephesiaca</cite> 106 sq. The <cite>Etymol.
Magn.</cite> has Ἐσσήν: ὁ βασιλεὺς κατὰ Ἐφεσίους,
and adds several absurd derivations
of the word. In the sense of ‘a
king’ it is used by Callimachus <cite>Hymn.
Jov. 66</cite> οὔ σε θεῶν ἐσσῆνα πάλιν θέσαν. It
is probably not a Greek word, as other
terms connected with the worship of
the Ephesian Artemis (e.g. μεγάβυζος,
a Persian word) point to an oriental
or at least a non-Greek origin; and
some have derived it from the Aramaic
הסין <em>chasin</em> ‘strong’ or ‘powerful.’
But there is no sufficient ground
for connecting it directly with the
name of the sect Ἐσσηνοί or Ἐσσαῖοι,
as some writers are disposed to do
(e.g. Spanheim on <cite>Callim.</cite> l.c., Creuzer
<cite>Symbolik</cite> <span class='fss'>IV.</span> pp. 347, 349); though
this view is favoured by the fact that
certain ascetic practices were enjoined
on these pagan ‘Essenes.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r273'>273</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Its date is fixed by the following
allusions. The temple at Jerusalem
has been destroyed by Titus (vv. 122
sq.), and the cities of Campania have
been overwhelmed in fire and ashes
(vv. 127 sq.). Nero has disappeared
and his disappearance has been followed
by bloody contests in Rome (vv.
116 sq.); but his return is still expected
(vv. 134 sq.).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f274'>

In an earlier passage vv. 8 sq. it is
said of God, οὔτε γὰρ οἴκον ἔχει ναῷ
λίθον ἱδρυθέντα κωφότατον νωδόν τε, βροτῶν

δέμας αἐνάοισι.  Another point of contact
with the Essenes is the great
stress on prayers before meals, ver. 26
εὐλογέοντες πρὶν πιέειν φαγέειν τε. Ewald
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Sibyll. Bücher</cite></span> p. 46) points also to
the prominence of the words εὐσεβεῖν,
εὐσεβής, εὐσεβία (vv. 26, 35, 42, 45,
133, 148, 151, 162, 165, 181, 183) to
designate the elect of God, as tending
in the same direction. The force of this
latter argument will depend mainly on
the derivation which is given to the
name <em>Essene</em>. See the appendix.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f276'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r276'>276</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus for instance, Ewald (l.c., p.
47) points to the tacit approval of marriage
in ver. 33. I hardly think however
that this passage, which merely condemns
adultery, can be taken to imply
so much. More irreconcilable with pure
Essenism is the belief in the resurrection
of the body and the future life
on earth, which is maintained in vv.
176 sq.; though Hilgenfeld (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>
<span class='fss'>XIV.</span> p. 49) does not recognise the difficulty.
See above p. 88. This Sibylline
writer was perhaps rather a Hemerobaptist
than an Essene. On the
relation of the Hemerobaptists and
Essenes see the appendix. Alexandre,
<cite>Orac. Sibyll.</cite> (<span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 323), says of this
Sibylline Oracle, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Ipse liber haud

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r278'>278</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The exceptional activity of the
forces of nature in these districts of
Asia Minor may have directed the
speculations of the Ionic school towards
physics, and more especially towards
cosmogony. In Heraclitus there is
also a strong mystical element. But
besides such broader affinities, I venture
to call attention to special dicta of
the two philosophers mentioned in the
text, which curiously recall the tenets
of the Judæo-Gnostic teachers. Thales
declared (Diog. Laert. i. 27) τὸν κόσμον
ἔμψυχον καὶ δαιμόνων πλήρη, or, as reported
by Aristotle (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de An.</cite></span> i. 5, p. 411),
πάντα πλήρη θεῶν εἰ<sup>ν</sup>αι. In a recorded
saying of Heraclitus we have the very
language of a Gnostic teacher; Clem.

the Phrygians should have taken this
direction, and that they should have
exchanged the fanatical orgiasm of their

sq.) attempts to show that Cerinthus
did not separate the Christ from
Jesus, and that Irenæus (and subsequent
authors copying him) have
wrongly attributed to this heretic the
theories of later Gnostics, seem insufficient
to outweigh these direct statements.
It is more probable that the
system of Cerinthus should have admitted
some foreign elements not very
consistent with his Judaic standing
point, than that these writers should
have been misinformed. Inconsistency
was a necessary condition of Judaic

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r335'>335</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Irenæus (iii. 11. 1), after speaking

that which he has before ascribed
to Cerinthus (i. 26. 1), but the
mode of statement may have been
borrowed from the Nicolaitans or from
some later Gnostics. There is however
no improbability in the supposition

Essenes writes, ‘From this view springs
the proverb; Every Chassid says; <em>Mine
and thine belong to thee</em> (not <em>me</em>)’ thus
giving a turn to the expression which
in its original connexion it does not
at all justify. Of the existence of such
a proverb I have found no traces. It
certainly is not suggested in the passage
of <cite>Pirke Aboth</cite>. Later in the volume
(p. 467) Grätz tacitly alters the
words to make them express reciprocation
or community of goods, substituting
‘Thine is mine’ for ‘Thine
is thine’ in the second clause; ‘The
Chassid must have no property of his
own, but must treat it as belonging to
the Society (שלי שלך שלך שלי חסיד).’
At least, as he gives no reference, I
suppose that he refers to the same
passage. In this loose way he treats
the whole subject. Keim (p. 294)
quotes the passage correctly, but refers
it nevertheless to Essene communism.</p>

ii. 8) relating to this point have been
frequently misunderstood, it may be
well once for all to explain his meaning.
The grades of the Essene order
are mentioned in two separate notices,
apparently, though not really, discordant.
(1) In § 10 he says that they are
‘divided into four sections according
to the duration of their discipline’
(διῄρηνται κατὰ χρόνον τῆς ἀσκήσεως
εἰς μοίρας τέσσαρας), adding that the
older members are considered to be
defiled by contact with the younger,
i.e. each superior grade by contact
with the inferior. So far his meaning
is clear. (2) In § 8 he states that one
who is anxious to become a member of
the sect undergoes a year’s probation,
submitting to discipline but ‘remaining
outside.’ Then, ‘after he has given
evidence of his perseverance (μετὰ τὴν
τῆς καρτερίας ἐπίδειξιν), his character
is tested for two years more; and, if
found worthy, he is accordingly admitted
into the society.’ A comparison
with the other passage shows that
these two years comprise the period
spent in the second and third grades,
each extending over a year. After
passing through these three stages in
three successive years, he enters upon
the fourth and highest grade, thus
becoming a perfect member.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated by Dr Ginsburg (<cite>Essenes</cite>
p. 12 sq., comp. Kitto’s <cite>Cyclopædia</cite>
s.v. p. 828) that the Essenes passed
through eight stages ‘from the beginning
of the noviciate to the achievement
of the highest spiritual state,’
this last stage qualifying them, like
Elias, to be forerunners of the Messiah.
But it is a pure hypothesis that
the Talmudical notices thus combined
have anything to do with the Essenes;
and, as I shall have occasion to point
out afterwards, there is no ground for
ascribing to this sect any Messianic
expectations whatever.</p>

sect which he calls the Nasareans, αὐτὴν

are seeking. The cradle of this sect
is placed by him in Gilead and Bashan
and ‘the regions beyond the Jordan.’
He uses similar language also (xxx. 18,
p. 142) in describing the Ebionites,
whom he places in much the same
localities (naming Moab also), and
whose Essene features are unmistakeable:
οὔτε γὰρ δέχονται τὴν πεντάτευχον

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r444'>444</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consistently with this view, we
may allow that single Indians would
visit Alexandria from time to time for
purposes of trade or for other reasons,
and not more than this is required by
the rhetorical passage in Dion Chrysost.
Or. xxxii (p. 373) ὁρῶ γὰρ ἔγωγε
οὐ μόνον Ἕλληνας παρ’ ὑμῖν ... ἀλλὰ
καὶ Βακτρίους καὶ Σκύθας καὶ Πέρσας καὶ
Ἰνδῶν τινάς. The qualifying τινας
shows how very slight was the communication
between India and Alexandria.
The mission of Pantænus
may have been suggested by the presence
of such stray visitors. Jerome
(<cite>Vir. Ill.</cite> 36) says that he went <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘rogatus
ab illius gentis legatis.’</span> It must
remain doubtful however, whether
some other region than Hindostan,
such as Æthiopia for instance, is not
meant, when Pantænus is said to have
gone to India: see Cave’s <cite>Lives of the
Primitive Fathers</cite> p. 188 sq.</p>

<p class='c000'>How very slight the communication
was between India and the West in
the early years of the Christian era,
appears from this passage of Strabo
<span class='fss'>XV.</span> 1. 4 (p. 686); καὶ οἱ νῦν δὲ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου
πλέοντες ἐμπορικοὶ τῷ Νείλῳ καὶ τῷ

μὲν καὶ περιπεπλεύκασι μέχρι τοῦ
Γάγγου, καὶ οὗτοι δ’ ἰδιῶται καὶ οὐδὲν
πρὸς ἱστορίαν τῶν τόπων χρῆσιμοι, after
which he goes on to say that the only
instance of Indian travellers in the
West was the embassy sent to Augustus
(see below p. 155), which came ἀφ’
ἑνὸς τόπου καὶ παρ’ ἑνὸς βασιλέως.</p>

<p class='c000'>The communications between India
and the West are investigated by two
recent writers, Reinaud <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Relations Politiques
et Commerciales de l’Empire
Romain avec l’Asie Centrale</cite></span>, Paris
1863, and Priaulx <cite>The Indian Travels
of Apollonius of Tyana and the Indian
Embassies to Rome</cite>, 1873. The latter
work, which is very thorough and
satisfactory, would have saved me
much labour of independent investigation,
if I had seen it in time.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f445'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r445'>445</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strabo <span class='fss'>XV.</span> 1. 59, p. 712. In the
MSS it is written Γαρμάνας, but this
must be an error either introduced by
Strabo’s transcribers or found in the
copy of Megasthenes which this author
used. This is plain not only from the
Indian word itself, but also from the
parallel passage in Clement of Alexandria
(<cite>Strom.</cite> i. 15).  From the coincidences
of language it is clear that
Clement also derived his information
from Megasthenes, whose name he
mentions just below. The fragments
of Megasthenes relating to the Indian
philosophers will be found in Müller
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Fragm. Hist. Græc.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 437. They
were previously edited by Schwanbeck,
<cite>Megasthenis Indica</cite> (Bonnæ 1846).</p>

<p class='c000'>For Σαρμᾶναι we also find the form
Σαμαναῖοι in other writers; e.g. Clem.
Alex. l.c., Bardesanes in Porphyr. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de
Abstin.</cite></span> iv. 17, Orig. <cite>c. Cels.</cite> i. 19 (<span class='fss'>I.</span>
p. 342). This divergence is explained
by the fact that the Pali word <em>sammana</em>
corresponds to the Sanskrit <em>sramana</em>.
See Schwanbeck, l.c. p. 17, quoted by
Müller p. 437.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be borne in mind however,
that several eminent Indian scholars
believe Megasthenes to have meant
not Buddhists but Brahmins by his
Σαρμάνας. So for instance Lassen
<cite>Rhein. Mus.</cite> 1833, p. 180 sq., <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ind.
Alterth.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>II.</span> p. 700: and Prof. Max
Müller (Pref. to Rogers’s <cite>Translation
of Buddhaghosha’s Parables</cite>, London
1870, p. lii) says; ‘That Lassen is
right in taking the Σαρμᾶναι, mentioned
by Megasthenes, for Brahmanic,
not for Buddhist ascetics, might be
proved also by their dress. Dresses
made of the bark of trees are not
Buddhistic.’ If this opinion be correct,
the earlier notices of Buddhism in
Greek writers entirely disappear, and
my position is strengthened. But for
the following reasons the other view
appears to me more probable: (1) The
term <em>sramana</em> is the common term
for the Buddhist ascetic, whereas it
is very seldom used of the Brahmin.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The Ζάρμανος (another form of
<em>sramana</em>), mentioned below p. 156,
note <a href='#f450'>450</a>, appears to have been a
Buddhist. This view is taken even
by Lassen, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ind. Alterth.</cite></span> <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 60.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The distinction of Βραχμᾶνες and
Σαρμᾶναι in Megasthenes or the writers
following him corresponds to the distinction
of Βραχμᾶνες and Σαμαναῖοι
in Bardesanes, Origen, and others;
and, as Schwanbeck has shown (l.c.),
the account of the Σαρμᾶναι in Megasthenes
for the most part is a close
parallel to the account of the Σαμαναῖοι
in Bardesanes (or at least in Porphyry’s
report of Bardesanes). It
seems more probable therefore that
Megasthenes has been guilty of confusion
in describing the dress of the
Σαρμᾶναι, than that Brahmins are intended
by the term.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pali form, Σαμαναῖοι, as a designation
of the Buddhists, first occurs
in Clement of Alexandria or Bardesanes,
whichever may be the earlier
writer. It is generally ascribed to
Alexander Polyhistor, who flourished
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 80–60, because his authority is
quoted by Cyril of Alexandria (c.
<cite>Julian</cite>. iv. p. 133) in the same context
in which the Σαμαναῖοι are mentioned.
This inference is drawn by Schwanbeck,
Max Müller, Lassen, and others.
An examination of Cyril’s language
however shows that the statement for
which he quotes the authority of Alexander
Polyhistor does not extend to
the mention of the Samanæi. Indeed
all the facts given in this passage of
Cyril (including the reference to Polyhistor)
are taken from Clement of
Alexandria (<cite>Strom.</cite> i. 15; see the next
note), whose account Cyril has abridged.
It is possible indeed that Clement
himself derived the statement from
Polyhistor, but nothing in Clement’s
own language points to this.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f446'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r446'>446</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The narrative of Bardesanes is
given by Porphyry <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Abst.</cite></span> iv. 17.
The Buddhist ascetics are there called
Σαμαναῖοι (see the last note). The
work of Bardesanes, recounting his
conversations with these Indian ambassadors,
is quoted again by Porphyry
in a fragment preserved by Stobæus
<cite>Ecl.</cite> iii. 56 (p. 141). In this last passage
the embassy is said to have arrived
ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας τῆς Ἀντωνίνου τοῦ ἐξ
Ἐμισῶν, by which, if the words be
correct, must be meant Elagabalus
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 218–222), the spurious Antonine
(see Hilgenfeld <cite>Bardesanes</cite> p. 12 sq.).
Other ancient authorities however place
Bardesanes in the reign of one of the
older Antonines; and, as the context
is somewhat corrupt, we cannot feel
quite certain about the date. Bardesanes
gives by far the most accurate
account of the Buddhists to be found
in any ancient Greek writer; but even
here the monstrous stories, which the
Indian ambassadors related to him,
show how little trustworthy such
sources of information were.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f447'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r447'>447</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Except possibly Arrian, <cite>Ind.</cite> viii.
1, who mentions an ancient Indian
king, Budyas (Βουδύας) by name; but
what he relates of him is quite inconsistent
with the history of Buddha,
and probably some one else is intended.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f448'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r448'>448</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this passage (<cite>Strom.</cite> i. 15, p.
359) Clement apparently mentions
these same persons three times, supposing
that he is describing three different
schools of Oriental philosophers.
(1) He speaks of Σαμαναῖοι Βάκτρων
(comp. Cyrill. Alex. l.c.); (2) He distinguishes
two classes of Indian gymnosophists,
whom he calls Σαρμᾶναι and
Βραχμᾶναι. These are Buddhists and
Brahmins respectively (see p. 153, note
<a href='#f445'>445</a>); (3) He says afterwards εἰσὶ δὲ
τῶν Ἰνδῶν οἱ τοῖς Βοῦττα πειθόμενοι
παραγγέλμασιν, ὃν δι’ ὑπερβολὴν σεμνότητος
εἰς [ὡς?] θεὸν τετιμήκασι.
Schwanbeck indeed maintains that Clement
here intends to describe the same
persons whom he has just mentioned
as Σαρμᾶναι; but this is not the natural
interpretation of his language, which
must mean ‘There are also among
the Indians those who obey the precepts
of Buddha.’ Probably Schwanbeck
is right in identifying the Σαρμᾶναι
with the Buddhist ascetics, but
Clement appears not to have known
this. In fact he has obtained his information
from different sources, and
so repeated himself without being aware
of it. Where he got the first fact it is
impossible to say. The second, as we
saw, was derived from Megasthenes.
The third, relating to Buddha, came,
as we may conjecture, either from
Pantænus (if indeed Hindostan is
really meant by the India of his missionary
labours) or from some chance
Indian visitor at Alexandria.</p>

<p class='c000'>In another passage (<cite>Strom.</cite> iii. 7,
p. 539) Clement speaks of certain Indian
celibates and ascetics, who are
called Σεμνοί. As he distinguishes
them from the gymnosophists, and
mentions the pyramid as a sacred
building with them, the identification
with the Buddhists can hardly be
doubted. Here therefore Σεμνοί is a
Grecized form of Σαμαναῖοι; and this
modification of the word would occur
naturally to Clement, because σεμνοί,
σεμνεῖον, were already used of the ascetic
life: e.g. Philo <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Vit. Cont.</cite></span> 3 (p.
475 <span class='fss'>M</span>) ἱερὸν ὃ καλεῖται σεμνεῖον καὶ

<div class='footnote' id='f450'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r450'>450</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The chief authority is Nicolaus of
Damascus in Strabo xv. i. 73 (p. 270).
The incident is mentioned also in Dion
Cass. liv. 9. Nicolaus had met these
ambassadors at Antioch, and gives an
interesting account of the motley company
and their strange presents. This
fanatic, who was one of the number,
immolated himself in the presence of
an astonished crowd, and perhaps of
the emperor himself, at Athens. He
anointed himself and then leapt smiling
on the pyre. The inscription on
his tomb was Ζαρμανοχηγὰς Ἰνδὸς ἀπὸ
Βαργόσης κατὰ τὰ πάτρια Ἰνδῶν ἔθη
ἑαυτὸν ἀπαθανατίσας κεῖται. The tomb
was visible at least as late as the age
of Plutarch, who recording the self-immolation
of Calanus before Alexander
(<cite>Vit. Alex.</cite> 69) says, τοῦτο πολλοῖς
ἔτεσιν ὕστερον ἄλλος Ἰνδὸς ἐν Ἀθήναις
Καίσαρί συνὼν ἐποίησε, καὶ δείκνυται μέχρι
νῦν τὸ μνημεῖον Ἰνδοῦ προσαγορευόμενον.
Strabo also places the two incidents in
conjunction in another passage in
which he refers to this person, xv. 1. 4
(p. 686) ὁ κατακαύσας ἑαυτὸν Ἀθήνησι
σοφιστὴς Ἰνδός, καθάπερ καὶ ὁ Κάλανος
κ.τ.λ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasons for supposing this person
to have been a Buddhist, rather
than a Brahmin, are: (1) The name
Ζαρμανοχηγὰς (which appears with
some variations in the MSS of Strabo),
being apparently the Indian <em>sramanakarja</em>,
i.e. ‘teacher of the ascetics,’
in other words, a Buddhist priest; (2)
The place Bargosa, i.e. Barygaza,
where Buddhism flourished in that
age. See Priaulx p. 78 sq. In Dion
Cassius it is written Ζάρμαρος.</p>

<p class='c000'>And have we not here an explanation
of 1 Cor. xiii. 3, if ἵνα καυθήσωμαι
be the right reading? The passage,
being written before the fires of
the Neronian persecution, requires explanation.
Now it is clear from Plutarch
that the ‘Tomb of the Indian’
was one of the sights shown to strangers
at Athens: and the Apostle, who
observed the altar <span class="uncial">αγνωϲτωι θεωι</span>,
was not likely to overlook the sepulchre
with the strange inscription
<span class="uncial">εαυτον απαθανατιϲαϲ κειται</span>. Indeed
the incident would probably be
pressed on his notice in his discussions
with Stoics and Epicureans, and he
would be forced to declare himself as
to the value of these Indian self-immolations,
when he preached the doctrine
of self-sacrifice. We may well
imagine therefore that the fate of this
poor Buddhist fanatic was present to
his mind when he penned the words
καὶ ἐὰν παραδῶ τὸ σῶμά μου ... ἀγάπην δὲ
μὴ ἔχω, οὐδὲν ὠφελοῦμαι. Indeed it would
furnish an almost equally good illustration
of the text, whether we read ἵν
καυθήσωμαι or ἵνα καυχήσωμαι. Dion
Cassius (l.c.) suggests that the deed
was done ὑπὸ φιλοτιμίας or εἰς ἐπίδειζιν.
How much attention these religious
suicides of the Indians attracted in the
Apostolic age (doubtless because the
act of this Buddhist priest had brought
the subject vividly before men’s minds
in the West), we may infer from the
speech which Josephus puts in the
mouth of Eleazar (<cite>B.J.</cite>  vii. 8. 7), βλέψωμεν
εἰς Ἰνδοὺς τοὺς σοφίαν ἀσκέιν ὑπισχνουμένους ...
οἱ δὲ ... &nbsp;<em class='gesperrt'>πυρὶ τὸ σῶμα

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r451'>451</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the reign of Claudius an embassy
arrived from Taprobane (Ceylon);
and from these ambassadors Pliny derived
his information regarding the
island, <cite>N.H.</cite>  vi. 24. Respecting their
religion however he says only two
words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘coli Herculem,’</span> by whom probably
Rama is meant (Priaulx p. 116).

Thus Lipsius writes (p. 190), ‘In the
general development of Jewish life
Essenism occupies a far more subordinate
place than is commonly
ascribed to it.’ And Keim expresses
himself to the same effect (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 305).
Derenbourg also, after using similar
language, adds this wise caution, ‘In
any case, in the present state of our
acquaintance with the Essenes, which
is so imperfect and has no chance of
being extended, the greatest prudence
is required of science, if she prefers to
be true rather than adventurous, if she
has at heart rather to enlighten than to
surprise’ (p. 461). Even Grätz in one
passage can write soberly on this subject:
‘The Essenes had throughout
no influence on political movements,
from which they held aloof as far as
possible’ (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 86).</p>

it must signify rather ‘day-bathers’;

<p class='c000'>Josephus (<cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 5) represents
the Essenes as bathing, not at dawn,

With the former meaning it would denote
the <em>transitoriness</em>, with the latter
the <em>derivative character</em>, of John’s
ministry. There seems no reason for
excluding either idea here. Thus the
whole expression would mean ‘the

Ssabier u. der Ssabismus</cite></span> <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 100 sq.)
who has investigated the Arabic authorities
for their earlier history. The
names by which they are known are
(1) <em>Mendeans</em>, or more properly <em>Mandeans</em>,
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">מנדייא</span> <em>Mandāyē</em>, contracted
from <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">מנדא דחייא</span> <em>Mandā dĕchāyē</em> ‘the
word of life.’ This is their own name
among themselves, and points to their
Gnostic pretentions. (2) <em>Sabeans, Tsabiyun</em>,
possibly from the root <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">צבע</span> ‘to
dip’ on account of their frequent lustrations
(Chwolson <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 110; but see
<cite>Galatians</cite> p. 312), though this is
not the derivation of the word which
they themselves adopt, and other etymologies
have found favour with some
recent writers (see Petermann <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Herzog’s
Real-Encykl</cite></span>. Suppl. <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> p. 342 s.v.
Zabier). This is the name by which
they are known in the Koran and in
Arabic writers, and by which they call
themselves when speaking to others.
(3) <em>Nasoreans</em>, <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">נצורייא</span> <em>Nātsōrāyē</em>.
This term is at present confined to
those among them who are distinguished
in knowledge or in business.
(4) ‘Christians of St John, or Disciples
of St John’ (i.e. the Baptist).
This name is not known among themselves,
and was incorrectly given to
them by European travellers and missionaries.
At the same time John the
Baptist has a very prominent place in
their theological system, as the one
true prophet. On the other hand
they are not Christians in any sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Mandeans, the true Sabeans,
must not be confused with the false
Sabeans, polytheists and star-worshippers,
whose locality is Northern
Mesopotamia. Chwolson (<span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 139 sq.)
has shown that these last adopted the
name in the 9th century to escape
persecution from the Mohammedans,
because in the Koran the Sabeans, as
monotheists, are ranged with the Jews
and Christians, and viewed in a more
favourable light than polytheists. The
name however has generally been applied
in modern times to the false
rather than to the true Sabeans.</p>

stated that, as Christ had twelve leading

This, it is argued, was a providential
dispensation—the one number represents
the solar, the other the lunar
period; and so they illustrate another
point in this writer’s theory, that in
the syzygies the true and the false are
the male and female principle respectively.
Among these 30 disciples he
places Simon Magus. With this the
doctrine of the Mandeans stands in
direct opposition. They too have their
syzygies, but John with them represents
the true principle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r498'>498</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Grätz (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 233) considers this
narrative an interpolation made from
a Pauline point of view (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘eine paulinistische
Tendenz-interpolation’</span>).
This theory of interpolation, interposing
wherever the evidence is unfavourable,
cuts up all argument by the
roots. In this instance however Grätz
is consistently carrying out a principle,
which he broadly lays down elsewhere.
He regards it as the great
merit of Baur and his school, that
they explained the origin of the Gospels
by the conflict of two opposing
camps, the Ebionite and the Pauline.
‘By this master-key,’ he adds, ‘criticism
was first put in a position to test
what is historical in the Gospels, and
what bears the stamp of a polemical
tendency (was einen tendentiösen polemischen
Charakter hat). Indeed
by this means the element of trustworthy
history in the Gospels melts
down to a minimum’ (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 224). In
other words the judgment is not to be
pronounced upon the evidence, but
the evidence must be mutilated to suit
the judgment. The method is not new.
The sectarians of the second century,
whether Judaic or anti-Judaic, had
severally their ‘master-key.’ The
master-key of Marcion was a conflict
also—the antagonism of the Old and
New Testaments. Under his hands
the historical element in the New Testament
dissolved rapidly. The master-key
of the anti-Marcionite writer
of the Clementine Homilies was likewise
a conflict, though of another
kind—the conflict of fire and water, of
the sacrificial and the baptismal systems.
Wherever sacrifice was mentioned
with approval, there was a
‘Tendenz-interpolation’ (see above
p. 136). In this manner again the genuine
element in the Old Testament
melted down to a minimum.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f499'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r499'>499</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Grätz however (<span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 228) sees a
coincidence between Christ’s teaching
and Essenism in this notice. Not to
do him injustice, I will translate his
own words (correcting however several
misprints in the Greek): ‘For the connexion
of Jesus with the Essenes compare
moreover Mark xi. 16 καὶ οὐκ ἤφιεν
ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἵνα τις διενέγκῃ σκεῦος διὰ τοῦ
ἱεροῦ with Josephus <cite>B.J.</cite>  ii. 8. 9 ἀλλ’
οὐδὲ σκεῦός τι μετακινῆσαι θαρροῦσιν οἵ
Ἐσσαῖοἰ.’ He does not explain what
this notice, which refers solely to the
scrupulous observance of the sabbath,
has to do with the profanation of the
temple, with which the passage in the
Gospel is alone concerned. I have
seen Grätz’s history described as a
‘masterly’ work. The first requisites
in a historian are accuracy in stating
facts and sobriety in drawing inferences.
Without these, it is difficult to
see what claims a history can have to
this honourable epithet: and in those
portions of his work, which I have
consulted, I have not found either.</p>

rightly objects to assigning a
persistently active sense to a word

it two main senses, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘id quod impletur’</span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘id quo res impletur’</span>, the
latter being the more common. He
apparently considers that he has surmounted
the difficulties involved in
Storr’s view, for he speaks of this last
as a passive sense, though in fact it is
nothing more than <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘id quod implet’</span>
expressed in other words. In Rom.

<div class='footnote' id='f541'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r541'>541</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The English word complement has
two distinct senses. It is either (i)
the complete set, the entire quantity
or number, which satisfies a given
standard or cadre, as e.g. the complement
of a regiment; or (ii) the
number or quantity which, when added
to a preexisting number or quantity,
produces completeness; as e.g. the
complement of an angle, i.e. the angle
by which it falls short of being a
complete right angle. In other words,
it is either the whole or the part. As
a theological term, πλήρωμα corresponds
to the first of these two senses;
and with this meaning alone the word
‘complement’ will be used in the following
dissertation.</p>

contained in the short Syriac recension
of the Ignatian Epistles, though loosely
translated; the other is wanting there.
I need not stop to enquire whether the
second was written by St Ignatius himself
or by an interpolator. The interpolated
epistles, if they be interpolated,
can hardly be later than the middle
of the second century and are therefore
early enough to afford valuable illustrations
of the Apostles’ language.</p>

πληρώματι; but there is no reason

πάνυ καὶ δέδοικε τὰς κατὰ προβολὴν τῶν
γεγονότων οὐσίας ὁ Βασιλείδης. Basilides
asked why the absolute First
Cause should be likened to a spider
spinning threads from itself, or a smith
or carpenter working up his materials.
The later Basilideans, apparently influenced
by Valentinianism, superadded
to the teaching of their founder
in this respect; but the strong language
quoted by Hippolytus leaves no doubt
about the mind of Basilides himself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f558'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r558'>558</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the various modes in which
the relation of the absolute first principle
to the pleroma was represented
in different Valentinian schools, see
Iren. i. 1. 1, i. 2. 4, i. 11. 1, 3, 5, i. 12.
1, etc. The main distinction is that
stated in the text: the first principle
was represented in two ways; either
(i) as a monad, outside the pleroma;
or (ii) as a dyad, a syzygy, most commonly
under the designation of Βυθός
and Σιγή, included within the pleroma
but fenced off from the other æons.
The Valentinian doctrine as given by
Hippolytus (vi. 29 sq.) represents the
former type. There are good, though
perhaps not absolutely decisive, reasons
for supposing that this father gives
the original teaching of Valentinus
himself. For (1) this very doctrine of
the monad seems to point to an earlier
date. It is the link which connects
the system of Valentinus not only
with Pythagoreanism to which (as
Hippolytus points out) he was so
largely indebted, but also with the
teaching of the earlier heresiarch Basilides,
whose first principle likewise
was a monad, the absolute nothing,
the non-existent God. The conception
of the first principle as a dyad seems
to have been a later, and not very
happy, modification of the doctrine of
the founder, being in fact an extension
of the principle of syzygies which Valentinus
with a truer philosophical conception
had restricted to the derived
essences. (2) The exposition of Hippolytus
throughout exhibits a system
at once more consistent and more
simple, than the luxuriant developments
of the later Valentinians, such
as Ptolemæus and Marcus. (3) The
sequence of his statement points to
the same conclusion. He gives a consecutive
account of some one system,
turning aside from time to time to
notice the variations of different Valentinian
schools from this standard
and again resuming the main thread
of his exposition. It seems most natural
therefore that he should have
taken the system of the founder as his
basis. On the other hand Irenæus
(i. 11. 1) states that Valentinus represented
the first principle as a dyad
(Ἄρρητος or Βυθὁς, and Σιγή): but
there is no evidence that he had any
direct or indirect knowledge of the
writings of Valentinus himself, and
his information was derived from the
later disciples of the school, more
especially from the Ptolemæans.</p>

ὁῦτος ὅτι ἀφορίζει ἀπὸ τοῦ πληρώματος

between the πλήρωμα and ὑστέρημα)·

ὡς μὴ δύνασθαι μηδὲν τοῦ ὑστερήματος
καταγενέσθαι ἐγγὺς τῶν ἐντὸς πληρώματος
αἴωνων. Irenæus represents the
Marcosians as designating the Demiurge
καρπὸς ὑστερήματος i. 17. 2, i. 19.
1, ii. præf. 1, ii. 1. 1 (comp. i. 14. 1).
This was perhaps intended originally
as an antithesis to the name of the
Christ, who was καρπὸς πληρώματος.
The Marcosians however apparently
meant Sophia Achamoth by this ὑστερημα.
This transference from the
whole to the part would be in strict
accordance with their terminology: for
as they called the supramundane æons
πληρώματα (Iren. i. 14. 2, 5; quoted in
Hippol. vi. 43, 46), so also by analogy
they might designate the mundane
Powers ὑστερήματα (comp. Iren. i. 16.
3). The term, as it occurs in the document
used by Hippolytus, plainly denotes
the <em>whole</em> mundane region.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hippolytus does not use the word
κένωμα, though so common in Irenæus.
This fact seems to point to the earlier
date of the Valentinian document
which he uses, and so to bear out the
result arrived at in a previous note
(p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>) that we have here a work of

Lower down Heracleon says
ἦν αὐτῆς ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐν τῷ Αἰῶνι. By this
last expression I suppose he means
that the great æon Man of the Ogdoad,
the eternal archetype of mankind, comprises
in itself archetypes corresponding
to each individual man and woman,
not indeed of the whole human race
(for the Valentinian would exclude the
psychical and carnal portion from any
participation in this higher region)

complete. He enumerates and discusses
very thoroughly the opinions
of his predecessors, omitting hardly
anything relating to the literature of
the subject which was accessible at
the time when he wrote. His exposition
of his own view, though not less

clause to refer to the apocryphal
Epistle to the Laodiceans: and Fabricius
explains the reference similarly.
Such a reference however would be
quite out of place here. The whole
paragraph before and after is taken
up with discussing the Epistle to
the Hebrews; and the interposition
of just six words, referring to a
wholly different matter, is inconceivable.
We must therefore punctuate
either <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘alii autem Lucæ evangelistæ

The passage stands in the MS, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Fertur
etiam ad Laudecenses alia ad Alexandrinos
Pauli nomine fincte ad heresem
Marcionis et alia plura quæ in catholicam
eclesiam recepi non potest.’</span>
There is obviously some corruption in
the text. One very simple emendation
is the repetition of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘alia’</span>, so that
the words would run <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ad Laudicenses
alia, alia ad Alexandrinos’</span>. In this
case fincte (= finctæ) might refer to
the two epistles first mentioned, and
the Latin would construe intelligibly.
The writing described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ad Laodicenses
alia’</span> might then be the Epistle
to the Ephesians under its Marcionite
title, the writer probably not having
any personal knowledge of it, but supposing
from its name that it was a different
and a forged writing. But what
can then be the meaning of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘alia ad
Alexandrinos’</span>? Is it, as some have
thought, the Epistle to the Hebrews?
But this could not under any circumstances
be described as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘fincta ad hæresem
Marcionis’</span>, even though we
should strain the meaning of the
preposition and interpret the words
‘<em>against</em> the heresy of Marcion’. And
again our knowledge of Marcion’s Canon
is far too full to admit the hypothesis
that it included a spurious Epistle
to the Alexandrians, of which no
notice is elsewhere preserved. We are
therefore driven to the conclusion that
there is a hiatus here, as in other
places of this fragment, probably after
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Pauli nomine’</span>; and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘finctæ’</span> will then
refer not to the two epistles named
before, but to the mutilated epistles
of Marcion’s Canon which he had
‘tampered with to adapt them to his
heresy’. In this case the letter <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ad
Laudicenses’</span> may refer to our apocryphal
epistle or to some earlier forgery.</p>

There are two points worth observing
in the Phrygian legend, as illustrating
the Apostolic history. (1) It is a
miracle, which opens the eyes of the
peasant couple to the divinity of their
guests thus disguised; (2) The immediate
effect of this miracle is their
attempt to sacrifice to their divine
visitors, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘dis hospitibus mactare parabant’</span>.
The familiarity with this
beautiful story may have suggested to
the barbarians of Lystra, whose ‘Lycaonian
speech’ was not improbably
a dialect of Phrygian, that the same
two gods, Zeus and Hermes, had again
visited this region on an errand at
once of beneficence and of vengeance,
while at the same time it would prompt
them to conciliate the deities by a
similar mode of propitiation, ἤθελον

These words were found in writers
of Attic comedy (Pollux iii. 74 ἡ παρὰ

and doubtless they were heard commonly
in Attic homes. But were they
not learnt in the nursery from Phrygian
slaves? Ἀπφάριον appears in two
inscriptions almost as a proper name,
2637 Κλαυδία ἀπφάριον, 3277 ἀπφάριον
Λολλιανή. In no. 4207 (at Telmissus)
we have Ἑλένη ἡ καὶ Ἄφφιον, so that
it seems sometimes to have been employed
side by side with a Greek name;
comp. no. 3912 a Παπίας ... ὁ καλούμενος
Διογένης, quoted above p. 48. This
will account for the frequency of the
names, Apphia, Apphion, etc. In

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r687'>687</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This appears from the fact that

several times (e.g. 3827 x, 3846 p,
3846 x, 3846 z<sup>46</sup>, etc.); but also Ἄππης
3827 g, 3846 n, 3846 z<sup>77</sup>, still as a
woman’s name. These all occur in
the same neighbourhood, at Cotiæum
and Æzani. I have not noticed any
instance of this phenomenon in the
names Apphia, Apphion; though probably,
where Roman influences were
especially strong, there would be a
tendency to transform a Phrygian name
into a Roman, e.g. Apphia into Appia,
and Apphianus into Appianus.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f691'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r691'>691</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Greek historians of Rome

Ἄππιος and the road Ἀππία; so

<div class='footnote' id='f692'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r692'>692</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The point to be observed is that
examples of these names are thickest
in the heart of Phrygia, that they diminish
in frequency as Phrygian influence
becomes weaker, and that they
almost, though not entirely, disappear
in other parts of the Greek and Roman
world.</p>

tout ce qu’on en peut tirer par voie
de conséquence formait aussi, en fait,
l’état commun des esclaves dans la
plupart des pays. A toutes les époques,
dans toutes les situations de la
vie, cette autorité souveraine plane
sur eux et modifie leur destinée par
ses rigueurs comme par son indifference.
Dans l’âge de la force et dans
la plénitude de leurs facultés, elle les
vouait, à son choix, soit au travail,
soit au vice; au travail les natures
grossières; au vice, les natures plus
délicates, nourries pour le plaisir du
maître, et qui lorsqu’il en était las,
étaient reléguées dans la prostitution
a son profit. Avant et après l’âge du
travail, abandonnés a leur faiblesse ou
a leurs infirmités; enfants, ils grandissaient
dans le désordre; viellards, ils
mouraient souvent dans la misère;
morts, ils étaient quelquefois délaissés
sur la voie publique....’</span></p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f752'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r752'>752</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The clause, ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ δύνασαι
ἐλεύθερος γενέσθαι, μᾶλλον χρῆσαι, has
been differently interpreted from early
times, either as recommending the
slave to avail himself of any opportunity
of emancipation, or as advising
him to refuse the offer of freedom and
to remain in servitude. The earliest
commentator whose opinion I have
observed, Origen (in Cram. <cite>Cat.</cite> p.
140), interprets it as favourable to
liberty, but he confuses the meaning
by giving a metaphorical sense to
slavery, δοῦλον ὠνόμασεν ἀναγκαίως τὸν
γεγαμηκότα. Again, Severianus (ib. p.
141) distinctly explains it as recommending
a state of liberty. On the
other hand Chrysostom, while mentioning
that ‘certain persons’ interpret
it εἰ δύνασαι ἐλευθερωθῆναι, ἐλευθερώθητι,
himself supposes St Paul to advise the
slave’s remaining in slavery. And so
Theodoret and others. The balance
of argument seems to be decidedly in
favour of the former view.</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) The actual language must be
considered first. And here (i) the
particles εἰ καὶ will suit either interpretation.
If they are translated ‘even
though’, the clause recommends the
continuance in slavery. But καὶ may
be equally well taken with δύνασαι, and
the words will then mean ‘if it <em>should</em>
be in your power to obtain your freedom’.
So above ver. 11 ἐὰν δὲ καὶ
χωρισθῇ: comp. Luke xi. 18 εἰ δὲ καὶ
ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν διεμερίσθη, 1 Pet.
iii. 14 ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε διὰ δικαιοσύνην.
(ii) The expression μᾶλλον χρῆσαι
seems to direct the slave to <em>avail himself</em>
of some <em>new</em> opportunity offered,
and therefore to recommend liberty;
comp. ix. 12, 15.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The immediate context will
admit either interpretation. If slavery
be preferred, the sentence is continuous.
If liberty, the clause ἀλλ’ εἰ
καὶ ... μᾶλλον χρῆσαι is parenthetical.
In this latter case its motive is to
correct misapprehension, as if the
Apostle would say, ‘When I declare
the absolute indifference of the two
states in the sight of God, I do not
mean to say that you should not avail
yourselves of freedom, if it comes in
your way; it puts you in a more advantageous
position, and you will do
well to prefer it’. Such a corrective
parenthesis is altogether after St
Paul’s manner, and indeed instances
occur in this very context: e.g. ver.
11 ἐὰν δὲ καὶ χωρισθῇ κ.τ.λ., ver. 15
εἰ δὲ ὁ ἄπιστος χωρίζεται κ.τ.λ. This
last passage is an exact parallel, for
the γὰρ of ver. 16 is connected immediately
with ver. 14, the parenthesis
being disregarded as here.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The argument which seems decisive
is the extreme improbability
that St Paul should have recommended
slavery in preference to freedom. For
(i) Such a recommendation would be
alien to the spirit of a man whose
sense of political right was so strong,
and who asserted his citizenship so
stanchly on more than one occasion
(Acts xvi. 37, xxii. 28). (ii) The independent
position of the freeman
would give him an obvious advantage
in doing the work of Christ, which
it is difficult to imagine St Paul enjoining
him deliberately to forego.
(iii) Throughout the passage the Apostle,
while maintaining the indifference
of these earthly relations in the sight
of God, yet always gives the preference
to a position of <em>independence</em>,
whenever it comes to a Christian naturally
and without any undue impatience
on his part. The spirit
which animates St Paul’s injunctions
here may be seen from vv. 8, 11, 15,
26, 27 etc.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r757'>757</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It must not however be forgotten
that, even before Christianity became
the predominant religion, a more humane
spirit had entered into Roman
legislation. The important enactment
of Hadrian has been already
mentioned, p. 387, note <a href='#f746'>746</a>. Even earlier
the <em>lex Petronia</em> (of which the date
is uncertain) had prohibited masters
from making their slaves fight with
wild beasts in mere caprice and without
an order from a judge (Dig. xlviii.
8. 11); and Claudius (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 47), finding
that the practice of turning out sick
slaves into the streets to die was on
the increase, ordered that those who
survived this treatment should have
their freedom (Dion Cass. lx. 29, Suet.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Claud.</cite></span> 25). For these and similar
enactments of the heathen emperors
see Wallon <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 60 sq., <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Röm. Alterth.</cite></span>

p. 560 sq. The character of this exceptional
legislation is the strongest impeachment
of the general cruelty of the
law; while at the same time subsequent
notices show how very far from
effective it was even within its own
narrow limits. See for instance the
passage in Galen, v. p. 17 (ed. Kühn)
λακτίζουσι καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἐξορύττουσι
καὶ γραφέιῳ κεντοῦσιν κ.τ.λ. (comp.

Yet St Chrysostom himself pleads the
cause of slaves earnestly elsewhere.
In <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hom. xl. ad 1 Cor.</cite></span> x. p. 385 he says
of slavery, ‘It is the penalty of sin and
the punishment of disobedience. But
when Christ came, he annulled even
this, <em>For in Christ Jesus there is no
slave nor free</em>. Therefore it is not necessary
to have a slave; but, if it
should be necessary, then one only or
at most a second’. And he then tells
his audience that if they really care for
the welfare of slaves, they must ‘buy
them, and having taught them some
art that they may maintain themselves,
set them free.’ ‘I know,’ he adds,
‘that I am annoying my hearers; but
what can I do? For this purpose I am
appointed, and I will not cease speaking
so.’ On the attitude of this father
towards slavery see Möhler p. 89 sq.</p>

intentional, and have been retained. Likewise, on p. <a href='#Page_343'>343</a>, footnote <a href='#f609'>609</a> is
repeated. It seems most likely that the second instance is correct, but both have
been retained.</p>

<p class='c048'>On p. 416, in the Index, the entry for ἅλας refers to iv. 5.
However, the word and its gloss appear in <a href='#IV_6'>iv. 6</a>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
